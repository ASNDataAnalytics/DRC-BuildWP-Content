## Preface

Physicians in training represent the future practitioners in their field and provide a picture of the future supply. The experience of those completing their training and about to embark on their careers is also an indicator of physician demand in their specialty. For these reasons, the George Washington University Health Workforce Institute (GW-HWI) research team and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) have conducted an annual online survey of current nephrology fellows and trainees beginning in 2014 to obtain data on demographic and educational background, educational debt, career plans, job search experiences, and factors influencing job opportunities and choices.  

In 2018, the survey tool—slightly modified from 2014 and subsequent years—was distributed to 1329 ASN Fellow/Trainee members (to whom ASN offers free membership) in May and June 2018. Four hundred and seven (407) fellows or trainees provided informed consent and responded to the survey questions for an overall response rate of 30.6% (this analysis excludes pediatric nephrology fellows unless otherwise stated). Among the assumed 844 fellows in their first and second year of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)–accredited training programs, we received responses from 349 fellows (41.4% response rate). (2018 ACGME data was not available at the time this report was written; comparisons are made with 2017 ACGME data instead.) The response rate for second-year fellows was 41.7% (183 of 439) providing a good picture of the job market faced by new nephrologists. (The basic nephrology fellowship is 2 years, but many stay on for an additional year(s) for subspecialty training or research.)  


This report presents demographic information for respondents in all years of fellowship and training, as well as job market experiences and fellows’ plans for those completing their second year of fellowship or beyond. It also presents data on job offers accepted by nephrology fellows and their assessments of the overall state of the specialty and job market. For all of the statistical tests presented, we considered probability values <0.05 to be statistically significant.  

## Key Findings

### _Overview_

The three overarching themes that emerge from the 2018 survey and analysis of the trends over the past 4 years are similar to those identified in 2017:

* the job market for new nephrologists has continued a trend of steady improvement and increasing salaries for US medical graduates (USMGs) and international medical graduates (IMGs);
* the job market for USMGs was signifi	better than
for IMGs, who continue to represent a majority of the trainees; and
* lifestyle concerns remain important to fellows and may
be discouraging applicants to the specialty.

### _An Improving Job Market with Continued Challenge for IMGs_

Responses to a number of questions indicated the importance of lifestyle factors to fellows, 
both during training and for practice after training.

* Among nephrology fellows who had searched for a job, perceptions of local nephrology job opportunities maintained the improvement of recent years compared to earlier years for both USMGs and IMGs. The percent of USMGs who indicated “no jobs” or “very few jobs” in the national job market dropped from 13.1% in 2014 to 0% in 2018, and from 35.1% to 8.6% for the local job market. The only disappointment was an increase in the number of USMGs who indicated “no jobs” or “very few jobs” in the local job market from the 9.3% of 2017 to 15.1% in 2018, though this was still lower than in all years prior to 2017.

* While the view of the market was far more negative for IMGs than for USMGs, the improvement for IMGs was also impressive with the percentage responding “no jobs” or “very few jobs” dropping from 29.9% in 2014 to 9.8% in 2018 for the national job market, and from 56.3% to 29.6% for the local job market.

#### Percentage of Nephrology Fellows Responding “No Jobs” or “Very Few Jobs”

```{r exhibit-p1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-p1.png"))
```


* Fewer than two in five respondents (38.0%) who had searched for jobs reported having difficulty finding a satisfactory
position compared to 45.6% in 2017. There was a statistically significant difference between IMG and USMG fellows’
reports of difficulty finding a position (p=0.001): 49.4% of IMGs reported having difficulty finding a position they were
satisfied with, an improvement over the 55.4% of 2017 and the 70.0% of 2016. 21.1% of USMGs reported having
difficulty compared to 28.8% in 2016.

#### Percentage of Nephrology Fellows Having a Difficult Time Finding a Satisfactory Position

```{r exhibit-p2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-p2.png"))
```

* Overall, the percentage of respondents indicating that they had changed their plans because of limited nephrology job
opportunities continued its decline, from 42.9% in 2015 and 32.7% in 2017 to 28.9% in 2018. While both USMGs and
IMGs were less likely to report changing their plans in 2017 than in prior years, their likelihood of changing plans was
significantly different: only 12.3% of USMGs reported that they had to change plans, while 41.0% of IMGs reported
changing plans (p<0.001). This difference likely reflects more limited job opportunities that meet visa requirements
allowing IMGs to practice in the US.

#### Changing Plans Due to Limited Practice Opportunities

```{r exhibit-p3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-p3.png"))
```

* Fellows’ anticipated salaries in 2018 were higher than
in previous years; the median anticipated salary for
all demographic groups (by IMG status and sex) was
between $180,000 and 
$189,999, except for male
IMGs, where the median was between $190,000 and
$199,999. The mean anticipated salary was 
$198,000,
compared to $187,000 in 2017.

* USMGs were more likely than IMGs to report being
“Very satisfied” with their salary and compensation
(34.7% vs. 21.3%) but the difference was not
statistically significant.

* When asked to identify the incentives they had received
for accepting their primary job offers, respondents were
most likely to report receiving the following:  
    + Income guarantees (46.9%)
    + Support for MOC and CME (40.7%)
    + Career development opportunities (38.1%)
    + Relocation allowances (38.1%)
    + Sign-on bonus (27.4%)
    

#### Lifestyle Concerns

Responses to a number of questions indicated the importance of lifestyle factors to fellows, both during training and for
practice after training.  

* Respondents in their second year of fellowship or beyond rated the following factors as “very important” or “important” in their job selection:      
    + Frequency of overnight calls (94.7% very important or important)
    + Frequency of weekend duties (93.9%)
    + Length of each workday (91.7%)
    + Salary/compensation (90.9%)
    + Job/practice in desired practice setting (89.8%)
    + Job/practice in desired location (88.5%)

* This may reflect the nature of much of nephrology practice today and may be of concern to both nephrology fellows
and residents who do not select the specialty.

* The final section of the report includes comments from fellows regarding why they would or would not recommend
the specialty. The positive comments highlight the intellectual excitement and attraction of the specialty itself as well
as long term relationships with patients. The negative comments indicate the challenges that the specialty faces.
Fellows who would not recommend nephrology to medical students and residents cited the heavy workload, low
compensation, difficult schedule, undervaluing of the specialty by other specialties, and lack of opportunities that
support visas for IMGs as reasons for their negative assessments. This was consistent with the 2015, 2016 and 2017
responses.

## Other Findings
 
#### Recommending the Specialty

Despite their mixed assessments of the nephrology job market, a majority (78.8%) of fellows indicated they would
recommend nephrology to current medical students and residents, a notable improvement over previous years.
However, IMGs were significantly less likely than USMGs to report that they would recommend the specialty to others
(75.9% vs. 83.7%, respectively).  

#### Would Recommend Nephrology to Medical Students and Residents
    
```{r exhibit-p4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-p4.png"))
```    

* Fellows who said they would recommend nephrology to medical students and residents cited many of the same factors
mentioned by 2015, 2016 and 2017 respondents as reasons for their positive assessments: the intellectual challenge/
interest of the field, variety of activities, and long-term patient relationships.  

#### Next Steps for Fellows Completing Training

* Among respondents in their second year of fellowship or beyond who indicated their plans for the upcoming
year (n=239), the largest percentage planned to enter clinical nephrology practice (50.6%). One in three (33.4%)
are continuing their training: 16.7% in their current fellowship and 16.7% in subspecialty training or an additional
fellowship. Frequently reported areas of continuing training included research, transplant nephrology and critical care.
* Among the 2nd year respondents, USMGs were more likely to continue current fellowship (20.0% to 6.1%); IMGs were
more likely to take additional subspecialty training (24.6% IMGs to 13.8% USMGs).
* It pays to go on for additional training beyond 2 years. Those going into jobs following their 3rd or 4th year of training
earning on average $211,000 compared to an average of 
$195,000 for those going into jobs following only two years of
training.

#### Practice Setting

Among respondents who had already accepted job offers, the largest group (48.3%) reported that they planned to work
in nephrology group practices. Another 28.4% reported that they planned to work in academic nephrology practices,
9.5% said they planned to work in hospitals and 6.9% in multispecialty academic practices. Other settings included
multispecialty group practices (3.4%) and 2-person partnerships (3.4%). No 2018 respondents reported going to work in
solo practice.

#### Setting of Primary Nephrology Job

```{r exhibit-p5, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-p5.png"))
``` 

#### Practice in Underserved Areas
* As in previous years, IMGs appear to be making an important contribution to care in underserved areas with 11 IMGs
(17.2%) indicating an obligation to work in a federally designated Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA). This
apparently reflects the need to practice in an underserved area, such as under the Conrad 30 program, in order to
remain in the US.

#### The Job Market

* When asked an open-ended question regarding the types of jobs they perceived to be more and less available, newly
graduating fellows mentioned several types of jobs that were **more easily available** according to their experience:  
    + Private practice jobs
    + Jobs in remote, rural or undesirable areas
    + Jobs in solo or small practices/communities
    + Jobs in general nephrology rather than transplant nephrology

* They reported several types of jobs that were **less easily available**:  
    + Academic jobs
    + Jobs in metro areas or other preferred geographic areas
    + Jobs that meet visa requirements for IMGs

#### Compensation

As in 2017, there were some statistically significant differences between mean anticipated incomes between different
practice settings.

#### Base Salary by Practice Setting of Primary Nephrology Job

```{r exhibit-p6, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-p6.png"))
```     

Salaries differed by population density of the geographical area of practice, with the highest average incomes in rural areas
($269,300) and small cities 
($200,700), and lower incomes in suburban 
($188,900), large city areas other than inner city
($196,400), and inner city 
($190,300) areas. The difference between rural salaries and all others was statistically significant
(p<.001). It appears rural communities need to offer nephrologists considerably more compensation than they can get in
larger cities and suburban areas in order to recruit them.

#### Base Salary by Population Density of Primary Nephrology Job Location

```{r exhibit-p7, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-p7.png"))
``` 

#### Job Responsibilities

The vast majority of respondents cited hospital care and outpatient nephrology care among their primary job responsibilities
(98.3% and 95.7% respectively). Other responsibilities they listed included temporary dialysis catheter placement (31.9%),
kidney biopsy (31.0%), medical directorship with a dialysis provider (27.6%) and clinical research (21.6%).

## Overview of Respondents

The 407 respondents to the 2018 Nephrology Fellows Survey included fellows in their first and second year of their ACGME
training program, as well as third-, fourth-, and fifth-year fellows in subspecialty training or research positions. Of the 407
respondents, 241 had completed at least 2 years of nephrology training; 183 had searched for a job; and 118 had accepted
a job offer. Different sections of this report present findings on each of these groups of fellows. (The totals in each data table
vary depending on the number of respondents who answered the particular question or questions being shown.)

#### Exhibit 1: Respondents by Fellowship Year

```{r exhibit-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-1.png"))
``` 

To assess the representativeness of the survey sample, we compared several demographic and educational characteristics
of the 349 survey respondents in their first and second years of training to ACGME data on all 844 first- and second
year- fellows (we used 2017 data as the 2018 ACGME data has not been published at the time of writing this report).
Respondents in 2018 had very similar characteristics to the 2017 ACGME first- and second-year nephrology fellows,
although the survey sample included slightly fewer IMGs, males and African Americans and slightly more Hispanic/Latino
respondents. The percentage of African American survey respondents in their first and second years of training was lower
in 2018 than in 2017—6.6% vs. 7.7%; the percentage of Hispanic/Latino survey respondents was higher than in 2016
(10.6% compared to 8.9%).

#### Exhibit 2: Comparison of 1st- and 2nd-Year Fellow Survey Respondents with ACGME Data

```{r exhibit-2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-2.png"))
``` 

## Education, Citizenship Status, and Demographics of Respondents

This section presents data on the educational background, citizenship status, and demographics of all respondents to the 2018 Nephrology Fellow Survey.

#### Location of Medical School

#### Exhibit 3: Medical School

```{r exhibit-3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-3.png"))
``` 

As in previous years, most 2018 survey respondents (62.1%) attended medical school outside the United States. These
IMG respondents reported attending medical school in 50 different countries, the most frequently cited of which were
India (58 respondents); Pakistan (32 respondents); Dominica (11 respondents); Jordan, Nepal and Syria (9 respondents
each); China and Egypt (8 respondents each); Grenada and Iraq (7 respondents each); Dominican Republic, Japan and
Mexico (6 each); and Lebanon and Nigeria (5 each).

#### Exhibit 4: Citizenship Status

```{r exhibit-4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-4.png"))
``` 


The distribution of 2018 survey respondents’ citizenship status was also similar to that of previous years’ respondents. More than half of 2018 respondents (53.5%) reported that they were US citizens, either native born or naturalized, and 14.3% reported that they were permanent residents of the United States. About 32.2% of the respondents were non- citizen holders of H, J or other visas (a slightly higher percentage than in earlier years).  

As in previous years, we identified a number of respondents who could be considered US IMGs, that is, US citizens who received their medical education outside the US. Native-born US citizen IMGs represented 9.6% of all respondents
indicating they had received their medical education in another country in 2018 with naturalized U.S. citizen IMGs adding a further 20.3%.  

#### Sex

#### Exhibit 5: Sex of 2018 Respondents

```{r exhibit-5, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-5.png"))
``` 


As in previous years, the majority of 2018 survey respondents (62.8%) were male—a larger percentage than in 2016
(61.1%). The difference in gender balance between IMGs (66.9% male) and USMGs (55.6% male) was statistically
significant (p=0.024), unlike in 2016 and 2017 when the difference was not significant.

#### Age

#### Exhibit 6: Age of 2018 Respondents

```{r exhibit-6, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-6.png"))
``` 

Respondents ranged in age from 27 to 54 years old. As in previous years, the largest age group was 31 to 35 years, which included more than one-half of respondents. Also, as in 2017, IMG respondents were significantly older on average than USMG respondents on average (34.9 years vs. 32.9 years—p<0.001).

#### Race/Ethnicity

#### Exhibit 7: Race of 2018 Respondents

```{r exhibit-7, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-7.png"))
``` 

When asked to identify their race, the largest group of respondents identified themselves as Asian (40.8%), and the next largest group (36.8% of respondents) identified themselves as white. The distribution of race/ethnicity was significantly different across IMG categories: IMGs were significantly more likely to report being Asian (p<0.05, effect size=0.23) or of “other” race (p<0.01, effect size=0.45) than USMGs, and USMGs were significantly more likely to report being white than IMGs (p<0.01, effect size=0.65). The proportions of respondents who reported that they were black were not significantly different between the USMG and IMG groups (p=.098).

#### Exhibit 8: Ethnicity of 2018 Respondents

```{r exhibit-8, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-8.png"))
``` 

9.6% of all respondents identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino, more than the 8.2% of 2016. This is more than the 8.7% of ACGME nephrology residents and fellows who are Hispanic/Latino; however, because nephrology is accredited as a two-year program ACGME only capture 1st and 2nd year fellows (ACGME, Annual Resource Data Book, 2016-17). IMG respondents were less likely to identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino than USMG respondents, but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.684).

#### Educational Debt

#### Exhibit 9: Educational Debt

```{r exhibit-9, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-9.png"))
``` 

Respondents’ reported levels of educational debt varied from no debt to greater than $300,000. As in previous years, IMGs were much less likely to be in debt than USMGs: 68.4% of IMG respondents reported having no educational debt compared with only 23.1% of USMGs (p<0.001, effect size = 0.84). (Effect sizes are typically classified as 0.2 = low, 0.5
= medium, 0.8 = large; the measure of effect size used throughout is Cohen’s d.) An additional 17.0% of IMGs reported educational debt levels <$50,000. 
USMG respondents were more likely than IMGs to report debt levels in every debt tier beyond $50,000. More than 1 in 5 (21.0%) of USMG respondents and 4.5% of IMG respondents reported 
having >$300,000 of educational debt, compared to 2017 when the comparable figures were 17.2% and 6.5% respectively. IMG respondents had a median educational debt of 
$0, while USMG respondents had a median educational debt of between
$150,000 and 
$174,999, the same as in 2017 but still higher than in any of the previous survey years.

## Post-Training Plans (2nd-Year and Beyond Fellows Only)

#### Activity After Completion of Current Training Year

#### Exhibit 10: Activity After Completion of Current Training Year

```{r exhibit-10, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-10.png"))
``` 

Among respondents in their second year of fellowship or beyond who indicated their plans for the upcoming year (n=239),
the largest percentage planned to enter clinical nephrology practice (50.6%). One in three (33.4%) are continuing their
training: 16.7% in their current fellowship and 16.7% in subspecialty training or an additional fellowship.  

As seen in Exhibit 11, among the 78 fellows who planned to continue their training (either through additional subspecialty
training or by continuing in their current fellowships) and gave information about what further training they planned to
undertake, the largest groups said they planned to pursue training in research (35 respondents), transplant nephrology
(25 respondents) and critical care (7 respondents). A smaller group (4 respondents) said they planned to pursue training
in interventional nephrology. As in 2016, other types of training respondents mentioned included clinical nutrition and
glomerular disease.

#### Exhibit 11: Type of Continuing Training Pursued by Fellows

```{r exhibit-11, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-11.png"))
``` 

USMGs were significantly more likely than IMGs to
report that they planned to continue their current
fellowships (23.5% vs. 12.1%, p<.05, effect size = 0.31)
while IMGs were more likely than USMGs to be planning
additional subspecialty training or fellowship (21.5%
vs. 10.3%, p<.05, effect size=0.30). We found no other
significant differences in the distribution of anticipated
activities between USMG and IMG fellows. The patterns
were similar among 2nd year respondents only, with
USMGs more likely to be continuing current fellowship
(20.0% to 6.1%) and IMGs more likely to be taking
additional subspecialty training (24.6% to 13.8%).  

We found no significant differences in the distribution of
anticipated activities between male and female fellows.
Females were more likely than males to be temporarily
out of medicine (1.43% vs. 0%) but this difference was
not statistically significant (p=.13).

#### Job Selection

Respondents in their second year of fellowship or
beyond rated the following factors as very important or
important in their job selection:  

* Frequency of overnight calls (94.7% very important
or important)
* Frequency of weekend duties (93.9%)
* Length of each workday (91.7%)
* Salary/compensation (90.9%)
* Job/practice in in desired practice setting (89.8%)
* Job/practice in desired location (88.5%)

They rated the following factors as least important:  

* Taxes (52.9%)
* Cost of malpractice insurance (50.5%)
* Cost of setting up a medical practice (44.0%)
* Job/practice meets visa requirements (36.4%)
* Availability of part-time position (27.4%)

#### Factors Influencing Job Selection

#### Exhibit 12: Factors Influencing Job Selection

```{r exhibit-12, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-12.png"))
``` 

USMGs and IMGs differed significantly when rating the
following factors (in order of effect size):  

* Job/practice meets visa requirements (IMGs more likely
than USMGs to rate as very important, p<0.001, effect
size = 1.1)
* Predictable start time (IMGs more likely to rate as very
important, p<.01, effect size=0.41)
* Workday length (IMGs more likely to rate as very
important, p<.01, effect size=0.40)
* Salary/compensation (IMGs more likely than USMGs to
rate as very important, p=0.01, effect size=0.37)
* Climate (USMGs more likely to rate as very important,
p<.05, effect size=0.35)
* Part-time availability (USMGs more likely to rate as very
important, p<.05, effect size=0.33)
* Parental leave policy (IMGs more likely to rate as very
important, p<.05, effect size=0.33
* Weekend duties (IMGs more likely to rate as very
important, p<.05, effect size=0.28)

USMG and IMG fellows’ ratings of other factors were not
significantly different. Male and female fellows differed
significantly when rating the following factor:  

* Parental leave policy (female fellows more likely than
male fellows to rate as very important, p<0.001, effect
size=0.69)

Male and female fellows’ ratings of other factors were not
significantly different.

## Job Market Experiences and Perceptions

This section reports on the experiences of the 143
nephrology fellows who had searched for employment. As
in previous years, the job market was more challenging
for IMG fellows who were more likely than USMG fellows
to apply for large numbers of jobs, have difficulty finding
a satisfactory position, and change plans because of
limited opportunities. Nevertheless, signs of continued
improvement in the job market included fewer job
applications, fewer people receiving no job offers, fewer
IMGs reporting difficult finding a satisfactory position
and fewer people reporting lack of jobs in both local
and national job markets. Although these trends have
continued for several years now and provide some cause
for future optimism, there is a continuing sense that many
fellows are unable to find the kind of jobs they would have
preferred.  

#### Number of Job Applications

Among fellows who had searched for a job, 67.6%
reported applying for between 1 and 5 jobs, and 28.2%
reported that they had applied for at least 6 jobs (including
9.9% who applied for more than 10 jobs). A few fellows
(4.2%) reported that they had not applied for any jobs.  

We found a statistically significant difference in the
number of job applications between IMG and USMG
fellows (p=0.030): IMGs were more likely than USMGs
to apply for more than 10 jobs (14.5% of IMGs vs. 1.8%
of USMGs), and USMGs were more likely than IMGs to
apply for 1 to 5 jobs (82.5% vs. 57.8%). The percentage
of USMGs who reported that they applied for 6 or more
positions continued its steady decline declined from
43.5% in 2015 and 22.1% in 2017 to 14.1% in 2018. The
percentage of IMGs who reported applying for 6 or more
jobs similarly continued its decline from 63.3% in 2015
and 40.6% in 2017 to 37.4% in 2018.  

We found no statistically significant differences existed in
the number of job applications between male and female
fellows (p=0.97).  

#### Number of Job Offers

The majority of nephrology fellows (68.8%) reported
receiving between 1 and 3 job offers. A small number of
fellows reported receiving more than 10 job offers (1.4%),
and 4.3% of fellows reported receiving no job offers. The
percentage of USMGs who reported receiving no job
offers (1.8%) was similar to 2017 (1.7%) but lower than in
2016 (4.0%) and 2015 (3.8%).  

USMGs were more likely to report receiving 1 to 3 job
offers (80.4% vs. 61.4%), and IMGs were more likely to
report receiving no job offers (4.8% vs. 1.8%) but also
more likely to report receiving 4 offers or more (33.7% vs.
17.9%). The differences were not statistically significant.
We found no statistically significant differences in the
number of job offers between male and female fellows
(p=0.95).  

#### Difficulty Finding a Satisfactory Position

Fewer than half of respondents (38.0%) who had searched
for jobs reported having difficulty finding a satisfactory
position (Exhibit 13) compared to 45.6% in 2017. As
in 2017, we found a statistically significant difference
between IMG and USMG fellows’ reports of difficulty
finding a position (p=0.001): 49.4% of IMGs reported
having difficulty finding a position they were satisfied with,
an improvement over the 55.4% of 2017 and the 70.0%
of 2016. 21.1% of USMGs reported having difficulty
compared to 28.8% in 2016.  

We found no statistically significant difference in reports
of difficulty finding a position between male and female
fellows (p=0.81).

#### Exhibit 13: Percentage of Nephrology Fellows Having a Difficult Time Finding a Satisfactory Position

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-13.png"))
``` 

#### Reasons for Difficulty

Among the fellows who reported difficulty finding a satisfactory position, the top 3 most frequently cited reasons were
consistent from 2017 to 2018 though with a change in order (Exhibit 14). The reasons most frequently cited by 2018
fellows were inadequate salary/compensation (34% vs. 21.9% in 2017), lack of jobs/practice opportunities in desired
locations (24.5% of those reporting any difficulty vs. 31.5% in 2017) and lack of jobs/practice opportunities that meet
visa status requirements (22.6% vs. 16.4% in 2017).

#### Exhibit 14: Reasons for Difficulty

```{r exhibit-14, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-14.png"))
``` 

As in 2017, and as expected, IMGs were statistically significantly more likely than USMGs to cite lack of jobs that meet visa requirements (29.3% vs. 0%, p=0.033, effect size = 0.72). Also, as in 2017 USMGs were significantly more likely than IMGs to cite lack of jobs in desired locations (50.0% vs. 17.1%, p<.05, effect size=.79). IMGs were more likely to cite overall lack of jobs and opportunities (11.1% vs. 0%) but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.65).  

We found no statistically significant difference in the reasons for difficulty finding a position between male and female fellows (p=0.818 for any difficulty).

#### Changing Plans Due to Limited Practice Opportunities

Overall, the percentage of respondents indicating that they had changed their plans because of limited nephrology job opportunities continued its decline, from 42.9% in 2015 and 32.7% in 2018 to 29.3% in 2018 (Exhibit 15). While both USMGs and IMGs were less likely to report changing their plans in 2018 than in prior years, their likelihood of changing plans was significantly different: only 12.3% of USMGs reported that they had to change plans, while 41.0% of IMGs reported changing plans (p<0.001, effect size=0.66). This difference likely reflects a continuing lack of job opportunities that meet visa requirements while allowing IMGs to practice in their preferred locations or settings.

#### Exhibit 15: Changing Plans Due to Limited Practice Opportunities

```{r exhibit-15, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-15.png"))
```

We found no statistically significant differences in male and female fellows’ likelihood of changing their plans (p=0.41).

#### Job Market Perceptions

Survey respondents were asked to indicate their
perceptions of the local job market (within 50 miles of
where they trained) and the national job market. Response
options ranged from no jobs to many jobs. Key findings
include:  

* Perceptions of the local and national job markets have
continued to improve for both USMGs and IMGs;
* As in the previous years, the 2018 fellows were
more likely to indicate that there were few or no job
opportunities in the local job market compared to the
national market; and
* As in previous years, USMGs had a far more favorable
view of the local and national job markets than IMGs.

#### Local Job Market Perceptions

Among nephrology fellows who had searched for
jobs, perceptions of local nephrology job opportunities
continued to improve: while 37.7% reported in 2016
that there were many or some nephrology practice
opportunities within 50 miles of their training sites, and
41.5% did so in 2017, the proportion reporting the same in
2018 increased to 51.1%.  

We found a statistically significant difference in IMG and
USMG fellows’ assessments of local nephrology practice
opportunities with USMGs more likely than IMGs to report
that there were many or some job opportunities in their
local area (62.4% vs. 46.1%, p<0.01, effect size=0.60).  

We found no statistically significant differences in local
job market perceptions between male and female fellows
(p=0.50).

#### Exhibit 16: Percentage of Nephrology Fellows Responding “No Jobs” or “Very Few Jobs”

```{r exhibit-16, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-16.png"))
```

#### National Job Market Perceptions

Nephrology fellows continued to perceive national
nephrology job opportunities much more positively than
local opportunities: 83.1% reported there were some or
many nephrology practice opportunities nationally (up from
69.1% in 2016) compared to 41.5% reporting some or
many nephrology practice opportunities locally.  

As in 2017 we found a statistically significant difference
in IMG and USMG fellows’ assessments of national
nephrology practice opportunities, with USMGs more likely
than IMGs to report that there were many or some job
opportunities nationally (92.0% vs. 80.7%, p<0.01, effect
size=0.62).  

We found no statistically significant difference between
male and female fellows’ assessments of national
nephrology practice opportunities (p=0.36).  

#### Types of Jobs Available

When we asked fellows to indicate in an open-ended
question what types of jobs they perceived to be more and
less available for newly graduating fellows, they mentioned
several types of jobs that were more easily available
according to their experience:  

* Private practice jobs
* Jobs in remote, rural or undesirable areas
* Jobs in solo or small practices/communities
* Jobs in general nephrology rather than transplant
nephrology

They also mentioned several types of jobs that were less
easily available according to their experience:  

* Academic jobs
* Jobs in metro areas or other preferred geographic areas
* Jobs that meet visa requirements for IMGs

These lists were almost identical to the 2017 lists. As in
2017, a small number of respondents mentioned limited
availability of hospital jobs and private practice positions,
with the problem more acute when combined with one of
the other categories of shortfall such as urban situation.  

## Job Offer Characteristics

Among the 118 nephrology fellows who had already accepted job offers, we found the following with respect to their
salary and compensation expectations.  

#### Practice Setting

Among respondents who had already accepted job offers, the largest group (48.3%) reported that they planned to work
in nephrology group practices (Exhibit 17). Another 28.4% reported that they planned to work in academic nephrology
practices, 9.5% said they planned to work in hospitals and 6.9% in multispecialty academic practices. Other settings
included multispecialty group practices (3.4%) and 2-person partnerships (3.4%). No 2018 respondents reported going
to work in solo practice.

#### Exhibit 17: Setting of Primary Nephrology Job

```{r exhibit-17, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-17.png"))
```

None of the differences between USMGs and IMGs in setting distribution reached statistical significance.
Female fellows were more likely to report that they planned to work in academic nephrology (35.7% vs. 24.3%) and
multispecialty group practices (9.5% vs. 0%); male fellows were more likely to report that they planned to work in
nephrology group practices (52.7% vs. 40.5%), 2-person partnerships (4.1% vs. 2.4%) and hospitals (12.2% vs. 4.8%).
However, the only one of these differences that was statistically significant was the gender difference for working in
multispecialty group practices (p<.01, effect size=0.53).

#### Location of Practice

#### Exhibit 18: Location of Primary Nephrology Job (Demographics)

```{r exhibit-18, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-18.png"))
```

Among respondents with job offers, the majority (63.1%) indicated that they planned to work in urban areas (inner city or
other). Another 17.5% said they planned to work in suburban areas, and 12.3% said they planned to work in small cities.
Similar to 2017, when 9 fellows (7.8% of respondents) reported intending to work in a rural area, in 2018 there were 8
fellows (7.0% of respondents) reporting intending to work in a rural area.  

USMGs were more likely to report intending to work in other urban areas (30.6% vs. 23.1%) and suburban areas (18.4%
vs. 16.9%) while IMGs were more likely to report intending to work in small cities (13.8% vs. 10.2%) and rural areas
(9.2% vs. 4.1%). USMGs and IMGs were equally likely to report intending to work in inner cities (36.7% vs. 36.9%). Unlike in 2017, none of the differences between USMGs and IMG fellows were statistically significant.  

We found no statistically significant differences between male and female fellows’ anticipated practice locations (p=0.36).

#### Obligations to Practice in Underserved Areas

#### Exhibit 19: Service Obligation

```{r exhibit-19, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-19.png"))
```

A total of 15 respondents had accepted jobs that came with a service obligation period. IMGs were more likely than
USMGs to accept a job that entailed a minimum service obligation period (18.8% vs. 6.1%). The difference in the
distribution of service obligations by IMG status was almost significant (p<0.056).  

There was little difference between females and males in the proportion accepting a minimum service obligation (15.4%
vs. 12.2%).

#### Exhibit 20: Reason for Service Obligation

```{r exhibit-20, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-20.png"))
```

Of the 15 service obligation positions reported, 11 (73.3%) were J visa waiver positions, 10 of them under the Conrad
State 30 program and the other under the Delta Regional Authority’s program. Of these 11 positions, 10 were for
positions based in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA); the other was for service in a rural area. All of the waiver
positions were held by IMGs.  

The other four positions were obligations under T32 and TL1 training grants from NIH (one each), one with the U.S. Army
and the other an unspecified income guarantee program. Three of the four non-waiver positions were held by US-born
USMGs, with the remaining position held by an IMG who was nevertheless a native-born US citizen.  

All respondents who were not U.S. citizens or permanent residents were asked about their interest in the physician
National Interest Waiver, which permits those holding temporary worker visas to apply for U.S. permanent residency after
five years of service in a designated shortage area. More than half (54.5%) expressed interest, with only 15.4% definitely
not interested.  

We found no statistically significant differences between male and female fellows’ anticipated practice locations (p=0.36).    

#### Exhibit 21: Interest in Physician National Interest Waiver

```{r exhibit-21, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-21.png"))
```

#### Base Salary/Income

Among the fellows who had accepted job offers, the range
of expected salaries was from <$80,000 to 
$329,999.
More than three out of five (62.0%) anticipated annual
base salaries between $140,000 and 
$209,999.  

Male IMGs had the highest median expected base
salaries of all demographic groups by IMG status and
gender, in the range $190,000–
$199,999. Female USMGs
and IMGs and Male USMGs all had median expected
base salaries in the range $180,000–
$189,999.  

Exhibit 22 shows that female USMGs had average
expected base salaries $22,000 higher than male USMGs
though the difference was not statistically significant
(p=0.16) and the median salary was the same for both
females and males (in the $180,000-
$189,999 range).
The higher average salary for females is in line with 2017
but not with earlier years’ surveys. As in 2017 the lower
average male USMG salary remained after controlling
for hours worked. Removing highly paid positions in
multispecialty group practices (two female USMGs but no
male USMGs) reduced the salary difference (to $9,000)
but did not remove it entirely. Now that this apparent
anomaly has persisted across two years’ of surveys,
additional research may be warranted to explore this in
more depth.  

In contrast to the position with USMGs, female IMGs had
a $15,000 lower average expected base salaries than
male IMGs (though this difference was not statistically
significant, p=0.34), and also a lower median income (in
the $180,000-
$189,999 range 
vs. $190,000-
$199,999
range for males). IMGs overall had an almost $18,000
higher average expected base salaries than USMGs,
a difference that, as in 2017, was almost statistically
significant in a one-sided t-test (p=.051), and also a
higher median income (in the $190,000-
$19,999 range vs.
$180,000-
$189,999 range for USMGs).  

(Because survey respondents were only asked to report
their salaries within $10,000 ranges, the calculation of
mean values set out in Exhibit 22 relies on the assumption
that actual salaries were evenly distributed within each
salary range, which cannot be guaranteed.)  

Somewhat surprising, male USMGs were making
considerably less than male IMGs and female USMGs
(male USMGs: $181,000; 
male IMGs: $211,600; female
US MGs: $203,800). Given the small sample size in each
category, it is difficult to identify the key factors leading
to these differences. In regard to male USMGs and IMGs,
it appears that male USMGs are more likely to work in
academia than male IMGs (39.4% vs. 24.4%). Male IMGs
also report spending more time on patient care relative to
male USMGs (27.5% work 60 or more hours per week on
patient care vs. 6.1%) while male USMGs report spending
more time on teaching and research. Interestingly, IMGs
report a more difficult time finding a satisfactory position,
and rate salary as more important than USMGs despite
having far less debt than IMGs.

```

Exhibits 23 and 24 show fellows’ expected base salaries in histogram form. In the histograms IMGs are mostly in higher
numbers than USMGs above $160,000 and in lower 
numbers from $100,000 up to 
$160,000 with the difference in overall
distribution of expected salaries between IMGs and USMGs just reaching statistical significance (p=0.046, Wilcoxon
rank-sum test). The difference in the pattern of salaries for male and female fellows was unclear. However, the difference
was not statistically significant (p=0.11).

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-24.png"))
```

#### Anticipated Additional Incentive Income

Less than half (41.7%) of fellows who had accepted job offers did not anticipate receiving any additional incentive
income. Among those expecting to receive incentive income, most reported that they expected to earn less than
$15,000, although the range of expected incentives 
extended beyond $30,000 
for 12.5% of fellows and beyond $60,000
for 4.0%.  

Exhibits 25 and 26 show fellows’ expected incentive income in histogram form by IMG status and by sex. We found
no significant differences in mean expected incentive income between IMGs and USMGs (p=0.12) or male and female
fellows (p=0.27).

```

#### Secondary Jobs
Among the respondents who had accepted nephrology
jobs, 16 indicated that they planned to take on a second
nephrology job in addition to their primary job. The
largest response was for hospital care (6 respondents,
37.5%). Other types of secondary jobs included medical
directorships with dialysis providers (5 respondents,
31.3%), moonlighting in nephrology inpatient units (4
respondents, 25%), moonlighting in non-nephrology
inpatient units (4 respondents, 25%), outpatient
nephrology care (1 respondent, 6.3%) and joint ventures
with dialysis providers (1 respondent, 6.3%).  

Among fellows who reported their expected income from
secondary nephrology jobs, three quarters (75%) expected
to earn less than $30,000 in their secondary jobs. Only 2
respondents (16.5%) expected to earn more than $50,000
from secondary nephrology jobs.  

#### Base Salary Comparisons by Practice Demography and Setting

When we compared base salaries between fellows
planning to work in different practice locations (e.g., inner
cities, suburban areas) we found the highest average
incomes in rural areas ($269,300) and small 
city ($200,700),
with lower incomes in suburban ($188,900), large city areas
other than inner city ($196,400), and inner 
city ($190,300)
areas (Exhibit 27). The difference between rural salaries
and all others was statistically significant (p<.001). This
finding reinforces the 2017 results but stands in contrast to
2016 when the differences were not statistically significant.
The only difference between USMGs and IMGs that was
statistically significant was for small cities, where IMGs
were earning almost $65,000 more than 
USMGs ($223,900
vs. $159,000, p<.01).

#### Exhibit 27: Distribution of Expected Base Salary by Demography

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-27.png"))
```

As in 2017 we found differences between mean anticipated incomes between different practice settings: fellows planning
to work in multispecialty academic nephrology ($167,900), 
academic nephrology ($179,800) and nephrology group practice
($197,600) had the lowest mean anticipated incomes, while fellows planning to work in multispecialty group practices
($285,000, but only three respondents), 
hospitals ($240,000) and 2-person 
partnerships ($230,000) had the highest mean
anticipated incomes (Exhibit 28). The difference between multispecialty group practice mean salary and all others was
statistically significant (p<0.01), as were the differences between mean salary in academic nephrology positions and
all others (p<0.05) and hospital positions and all others (p<0.05). The only difference between USMGs and IMGs that
approached statistical significance was in multispecialty academic practices, where IMGs earned $235,000 compared to
$170,000 for USMGs (p=.055). No significant differences were found between male and female salaries by practice setting.

```

#### Satisfaction with Salary/Compensation

The majority of fellows who had accepted job offers indicated they were satisfied with their salary and compensation. Some
27.3% reported being “very satisfied,” (higher than the correspondent figure of 20.4% in 2017 but lower than the 31.6% in
2016), while 50.9% indicated that they were “somewhat satisfied” with their salary and compensation.  

USMGs were more likely to report being “very satisfied” with their salary and compensation (34.7% vs. 21.3%), while IMGs
were more likely to report being “somewhat satisfied” (57.4% vs. 42.9%). The differences were not statistically significant
(p=.30).  

Female fellows were much more likely than males to report being “very satisfied” with their salary and compensation
(39.5% vs. 20.8% for males), much higher than the 23.3% in 2017 and approaching the corresponding figure of 48.7%
for females in 2016, while male fellows were more likely to report being “somewhat satisfied” (55.6% vs. 42.1%) and
“somewhat dissatisfied” (20.8% vs. 13.2%). Again, the differences were not statistically significant (p=0.14).  

Those with higher salaries were generally the most satisfied. The difference in mean salary between the ‘very satisfied’ and
the ‘somewhat dissatisfied’ groups was around $70,000.

#### Incentives

When asked to identify the incentives they had received for
accepting their primary job offers, respondents were most
likely to report receiving the following:  

* Income guarantees (46.9%)
* Support for MOC and CME (40.7%)
* Career development opportunities (38.1%)
* Relocation allowances (38.1%)
* Sign-on bonus (27.4%)

Educational loan repayment (3.5%) and on-call payments
(3.5%) were the least frequently reported incentives.
Another 14.2% of respondents who had accepted jobs
reported receiving no incentives.  

Not surprisingly, we found statistically significant
differences between IMG and USMG respondents’ reports
of receiving H-1 visa sponsorship (20.3% vs. 2.0%,
p<0.05, effect size=0.47) and J-1 visa waivers (17.2% vs.
0%, p=.011, effect size=0.50). A statistically significant
difference was also found between IMGs’ and USMGs’
reports of receiving a sign-on bonus (21.9% vs. 34.7%,
p<.05. effect size=0.32), support for maintenance of
certification and CME (35.9% vs. 46.9%, p<.05, effect
size=0.28), and career development opportunities (31.3%
vs. 46.9%, p<.05, effect size=0.36). USMGs were more
likely than IMGs to report receiving no incentives (20.4%
vs. 9.4%, p>.05, effect size=0.33).  

We also found large differences between male and female
respondents’ reported incentives in regard to income
guarantees (males 59.4% vs. females 30.6%), relocation
allowances (males 50.0% vs. females 22.4%) and support
for maintenance of certification and CME (males 51.6% vs.
females 26.5%) but none reached statistical significance
(p=.121, .078 and .151 respectively).  

Among respondents who reported receiving incentives
with their primary job offers, more than two-thirds (69.0%)
reported that they were “important” or “very important” in
their decision to accept the job. We found a statistically
significant difference between IMGs’ and USMGs’ ratings
of the importance of the incentives they had received with
USMGs more likely than IMGs to rate the incentives they
had received as “important” or “very important” (79.3% vs.
53.8%, p<0.01, effect size=0.5).  

We found no statistically significant differences between
male and female respondents’ ratings of the importance of
the incentives they had received (p=0.46).

#### Exhibit 30: Incentives Received

#### Exhibit 31: Primary Job Responsibilities

```{r exhibit-31, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-31.png"))
```

The vast majority of respondents cited hospital care and outpatient nephrology care among their primary job responsibilities
(98.3% and 95.7% respectively). Other responsibilities they listed included temporary dialysis catheter placement (31.9%),
kidney biopsy (31.0%), medical directorship with a dialysis provider (27.6%) and clinical research (21.6%).

#### Conditions Fellows Expect to Treat

When asked to identify the top 3 conditions they expected to treat in their practice (both primary and secondary
jobs), respondents who had accepted job offers most frequently cited ESRD (89.5%), CKD (86.8%), AKI (65.8%), and
hypertension (36.0%)—the same conditions as in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The least frequently expected conditions were GN
and nephrolithiasis (7.0% each), cystic kidney diseases (3.5%), and kidney cancer (2.6%)— the last two being the same
conditions cited in 2016.

#### Exhibit 32: Conditions Fellows Expect to Treat

```{r exhibit-32, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-32.png"))
```

Among dialysis modalities (N=114), respondents who had accepted job offers were most likely to expect to work with
in-center hemodialysis (100%), followed by home peritoneal dialysis (71.1%), and home hemodialysis (44.7%). A much
smaller group (14.0%) said they anticipated working with nocturnal in-center hemodialysis.

#### Exhibit 33: Consideration Given to a Career Outside Nephrology

```{r exhibit-33, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-33.png"))
```

The majority of respondents (64.5%) had seriously considered another specialty before deciding to pursue nephrology. In
the 171 written responses, the most frequently mentioned alternative specialties were pulmonary and critical care (30.4%
of 191 total specialty mentions), cardiology (25.1%) and hematology/oncology (10.5%). Gastroenterology, endocrinology,
infectious diseases, hospital medicine and rheumatology (in decreasing order of frequency) were also mentioned. IMGs
were significantly less likely than USMGs to have considered another specialty before deciding on nephrology (41.4% vs.
25.5%, p<.01, effect size=0.33 ).

#### Exhibit 34: Level of Preparedness for General Nephrology Practice


```{r exhibit-34, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "04_2018-Nephrology-Fellow-Survey-Figs/exhibit-34.png"))
```

The vast majority of respondents (94.6%) in their second year and beyond rated their level of preparedness for general
nephrology practice as “fully prepared” or “moderately prepared”, though less than half felt “fully prepared”. While only
5.3% felt either “minimally prepared” or “not prepared”, this is still of concern. More IMGs than USMGs felt “fully prepared”
(50.7% vs. 44.0%) but the difference was not significant.

## Would Fellows Recommend Nephrology?

Despite their mixed assessments of the nephrology job market, a majority (78.8%) of fellows indicated they would
recommend nephrology to current medical students and residents, rather higher than the 71.8% in 2016. However, IMGs
were less likely than USMGs to report that they would recommend the specialty to others (75.9% vs. 83.7%, respectively,
not significant, p=.075). We found no statistically significant difference between male and female fellows’ likelihood of
recommending nephrology (p=0.76).

#### Exhibit 35: Would Recommend Nephrology to Medical Students and Residents

```{r exhibit-35, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}

```

Fellows who said they would recommend nephrology to
medical students and residents cited many of the same
factors mentioned by previous years’ respondents as
reasons for their positive assessments: the intellectual
challenge/interest of the field, variety of activities, and
long-term patient relationships. Many expressed optimism
about an improving job market.  

Fellows who said they **would recommend nephrology**
to medical students and residents made the following
comments to support their assessments:  

* A thought-provoking field with lots of unknowns in
the field that are currently being investigated with new
information and new treatments coming to light
* Because of the diversity of the field and so many
different options after completing the basic training such
as interventional nephrology, transplant nephrology
* Fascinating pathology, varied job, high patient need.
Vulnerable patient population in need of good,
humanistic doctors. Huge opportunities for research
and academic careers. Ability to sub-sub-specialize
* Great opportunities and clinical need for patient care
and research. Practice, though challenging, is enriching
* I love nephrology. The job market is now better. It is
an intellectually challenging field and needs a good
understanding of basic pathophysiology
* I love what I do. There is always a beauty part behind
the problems
* I still love Nephrology, despite what all the naysayers
say. I know the economics are changing, and the
practice is not what it used to be. Maybe this is my
naivete speaking, because I have yet to enter the ‘real
world’ of practice. Maybe my opinions will change after
a few years. But I see on a daily basis the difference
I make in my patient’s lives on both the inpatient and
outpatient side of things. I feel that I have a unique
understanding of pathophysiology and can contribute
meaningfully to the care of those who just need
medication adjustments as well as those who need
advanced CKD care and renal replacement therapy
planning. I think part of my security comes from the fact
that in the future, I see many job opportunities available,
and I am relatively flexible in terms of geographic
location. Others who want to restrict to a certain
geographic location may not feel as secure, and may
resort to hospitalist work, which is sad because it is a
loss to the nephrology workforce. I do see a big future
for Nephrology and nephrologists in the era of valuebased
healthcare, where preventive approaches can be
quantified and followed.
* I think it is a great field and requires a lot of cerebral
work. Even though my fellowship is rigorous I enjoy
coming to work every day. We need more nephrologist
and to inspire more physicians to go into this field.
* I think nephrology is a fascinating field that needs more
smart young doctors to join it! Given the downtrend in
applicants this is the perfect time to get into the field
because more and more jobs will be available.
* I think one has to have an interest in nephrology to go
into it. If the med student/resident is suitable I would
recommend going into it. Job opportunity-wise, I think
the job market is changing. Fewer people entering
nephrology and more retiring will create a gap in the job
market and raise salaries in the long term. I see some
quiet desperation in my local market for nephrologists
because so few fellows are coming out of local training
programs.
* I think that though it is a subspecialty it is deeply
connected to many of the other subspecialties and
allows me to practice and exercise knowledge in
general internal medicine while also being a consultant.
It is also deeply satisfying and also fun to solve
electrolyte issues as well as navigate AKI and CKD.
* I was interested in nephrology due to my passion that
was obtained through my mentors. I would recommend
it for the people who have passion. Salary is only least
important for me.
* I would recommend it with the caveat that they should
only go into if they really love the subject. If you want
a specialty that is 9-5 and makes a lot of money,
Nephrology is not it. If you want a specialty with lots of
patient education and prolonged continuity of care, this
field is perfect.
* Intellectually challenging and stimulating. Very busy
work hours during 1st year fellowship and not good
lifestyle as a fellow due to high workload. But looking
forward to a better quality of life after fellowship as a
nephrologist in academic medicine
* Interesting field; can be well compensated in proper
setting, good lifestyle, great continuity of care, able to
treat the entire patient rather than a single organ system
* It is a beautiful subspecialty where you learn and
understand the very complex physiology and
mechanisms of the human body. You also become
very attached to the patients. The only thing that would
make this job perfect is if compensation is related to the
number of hours and effort you spend or the patients.
* It is a time-consuming, difficult, but incredibly rewarding
field that has numerous opportunities for personal growth, skill development, and leadership.
* It is a very fulfilling discipline in which not only you
utilize your brain on a daily basis but also form lifelong
relationships with your patients.
* It is a wonderful specialty with wonderful learning
opportunities and the ability to establish longitudinal
patient relationships.
* It makes you engaged in medicine all the time.
Interesting research areas covers wide range of areas.
Busy but as long as trying to find balance between life
and work, it will be all right
* It’s a nice field if you like physiology, pharmacy and
pathology. More importantly it’s a good field for critical
thinking and analysis.
* It’s a wonderful field with a lot of intellectual interest.
I recognize that job opportunities may be scarce
and become scarcer given some of the workforce
predictions but I believe that for trainees from wellregarded
programs there will continue to be excellent
opportunities
* It’s an interesting field that’s really exciting. It’s internal
medicine on steroids. Involves the basic sciences and
clinical practice
* It’s an interesting specialty deeply rooted in internal
medicine and human physiology. Plus, there are
no functional symptoms pertaining to Nephrology
specifically!
* Most nephrology groups are looking for people and
the number of patients will continue to grow. There is
variability not found in other subspecialties such as ICU,
inpatient floor, dialysis unit, clinic and this helps keep
things interesting.
* Most powerful specialty, that keep you up to date in
most of Medicine aspects. Also, Nephrology needs
smart people that they like to think and like challenging
cases.
* Nephrology cannot die. It is a field for never-ending
cognitive thirst. There is no other specialty that can
widen intellectual horizons as my field. I cannot think of
any other field.
* Nephrology is an awesome specialty and you get to see
patients with many different pathophysiologies and you
develop long-lasting relationships with many of these
patients.
* Nephrology is an intellectual specialty with a good
amount of general medicine. There is also a good mix of
inpatient and outpatient practice.
* Nephrology is the last resorts for all other medical
services in helping stabilize the Acid-Base, HTN,
electrolytes and volume status of the patient.
Nephrology takes care not only of the kidney, but of the
whole human organs and systems. I am very glad that I
chose this amazing subspecialty.
* Nephrology is very interesting and professionally
satisfying subject. For outsiders it may all be about
dialysis but the diagnoses can be challenging and
fun. Fluid and electrolyte management can get very
interesting and satisfying. Nephrology is one of the very
few specialties where one will be practicing internal
medicine with a touch of salt
* Nephrology is very interesting branch and I love it and it
incorporates and touches almost all branch of medicine
and keep me updated as an internist!
* Nephrology remains the go-to specialty for medical
students who are fascinated by physiology.
* The field will always be attractive to those who
enjoy thinking critically about their patients. With the
expected physician deficit in the next decade, the low
compensation (frequently cited by current medicine
residents as the biggest detraction to the subspecialty)
will likely increase under regular economic supply/
demand pressures.
* The practice of nephrology is cerebral, not procedural.
Nephrology is challenging, but always engaging.
* The practice of nephrology remains one of the most
intellectually stimulating fields, and has rewarding
interactions with patients, families, and other
physicians.
* There is high demand for private practitioners as well as
physician-scientists in Nephrology. I would encourage
physicians who want to be leaders in their field to
pursue Nephrology - there are opportunities open to
do so in public policy, research, and clinical practice.
Furthermore, Nephrologists have the opportunity to
teach their patients and other providers about kidney
disease, which is one of the most poorly understood
diseases in Medicine.
* They truly need to like nephrology in order to enjoy
the training mostly because of the work load and later
the compensation. But if someone genuinely likes
nephrology I would encourage pursuit if said resident/
student is considering it as a specialty. Better job
availability and overall pay here in the southwest is still
good, I think.
* Very rewarding field of medicine. You have the
opportunity maintain relationships with panel of
patients for many years. There are many opportunities
for graduating fellows, but you have to choose the
opportunity that suits your needs.

Fellows who said they would not recommend
nephrology to medical students and residents also cited
many of the same factors as previous years: the heavy
workload, low compensation, difficult schedule relative to
hospital medicine and other specialties, undervaluing of
the specialty by other specialties, and lack of opportunities
that support visas.  

Fellows who said they **would not recommend nephrology**
to medical students and residents made the following
comments to support their assessments:  

* As such Nephrology fellowship is very interesting and
wonderful, but life after fellowship is not promising. Lack
of job opportunities, long working hours at multiple sites
with very poor compensation. Jobs have very bad call
schedules (1:2 or 1:3), remote locations and poor quality
of life.
* For American graduates with undergraduate and
medical school loans it’s hard to recommend a
challenging subspecialty where it’s difficult to pay off
loans.
* Honestly, lifestyle and reimbursement is very important
to me. At the current rate, of the jobs I have seen or
Interviewed for, the lifestyle is poor where the work
schedule is hectic, unpredictable, involves covering
multiple facilities, and there is poor compensation
for the amount of work being done. Both hospitalist
and primary care have better reimbursements and a
better work schedule. I do love Nephrology and May
practice some Nephrology in the future, but I doubt I
will be solely a nephrologist. I will likely go into primary
care or hospitalist as my main focus, and only practice
Nephrology on the side. It is very discouraging for
someone to put in 2 extra years of training and have a
poorer lifestyle and poor reimbursements. Therefore,
I would not recommend this field to other students or
residents unless this changes. It’s a waste of 2 years is
you can’t get a job that is better then being an internist.
The whole point of fellowship is to advance your career
in a field that you like, and do make a decent living
out of doing the subspecialty you chose. I feel the job
satisfaction is lacking in Nephrology, more than other
subspecialties.
* I love nephrology but the lifestyle is terrible. Long hours,
lots of call, small salary, not a lot of jobs, etc.
* I think that the level of mental work, emotional
support for dialysis patients, and overall workload in
nephrology is not reflected in the average financial
compensation for nephrologists. Unless you already
like nephrology, e.g. you would be happy practicing
nephrology regardless of the paycheck relative to other
subspecialties, I do not recommend doing it.
* Lack of good jobs with good work/life balance is not
present in nephrology. Getting paid below hospitalist
salary on graduation is a depressing factor.
* Lack of respect from other specialties.
* Meager pay for really really hard work. I like nephrology
but not worth wasting time for 2 years and then involve
in taking care of serious sick patients and paid less.I
have to travel approx 1-2 hrs across 2-3 hospitals just
to see more patients and earn more but the same as
hospitalist who works half days, earns more, and more
importantly saves a lot of time. Not worth the time and
effort.
* Nephrology fellowship is one of the busiest fellowships
with huge patients load, complexity and severity of the
cases, despite of that at the end of it there is limited job
opportunities and very low payment, compared to doing
no fellowship at all, hospitalist job has more flexibility
and better compensation
* Nephrology training is very tough and the compensation
is not worth your efforts unless you are really interested
in Nephrology. Nephrology compensation is a joke,
you are compared to Rheumatology and Endocrine,
how many of the rheumatologists are taking night and
weekend call, for that matter they don’t even come to
hospital
* Not enough respect to the amount of work we do, we
ought to be treated more appropriately rather than
getting the page ‘Come dialyze’
* Not worth the time for the compensation and call/work
responsibilities.
* Physicians with long term visa requirement (especially
from India, China, ...) have 1/4th of jobs compared
to other physicians. Most of the jobs in rural areas.
Metropolitan jobs don’t pay well. Group practices don’t
offer partnership that easy. Considering all of these
would highly recommend hospitalist.
* The amount of work nephrologist and the patient
population does not correlate with compensation. Most
of us graduate with too much student loans and do not 
see an incentive of making less and getting overworked. Right hospitalist Job is default to all young graduating
physician.
* The students and residents should rotate in nephrology
consult services and may need to observe some
outpatient practices including dialysis units so that it
helps them decide their future career.
* Too much work, too little pay, unrealistic expectations,
too many fellowship positions for too few jobs.
* Unless he / she really wants to learn and understand
renal pathophysiology , there are no lucrative jobs out
there. Low salary and high workload
* Very demanding field in terms of knowledge, very few
jobs, bad salaries, bad life style, waste of time, as a
hospitalist u make almost double and have 2 weeks off
a month and u sleep at night
* Quality of life is terrible as a fellow and seems to be
poor in practice when compared to other specialties like
rheumatology
* Very stressful, fellowship is horribly busy. didn’t sleep
good for months. not much money after graduation.
hospitalist friends are making double.
