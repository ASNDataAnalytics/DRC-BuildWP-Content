## Executive Summary

Since 2014 the George Washington University Health Workforce Institute (GW-HWI) in collaboration with the American
Society of Nephrology (ASN) has surveyed nephrology fellows, tracking their transition to practice and their experience
in the job market. In 2017, GW-HWI surveyed recent fellowship graduates to explore the practices, satisfaction and
view of the specialty of early career nephrologists.
GW-HWI surveyed nephrologists who had completed their nephrology training between 2011 and 2016. There were
270 valid responses (an 11% response rate). While this response rate is low, a comparison with ACGME data on recent
nephrology fellows indicates that the characteristics of respondents are generally consistent with the characteristics of
recent graduates. The responses provide a good picture of the early career nephrologist.

After reviewing the results by gender, location/type of education (US medical graduates [USMGs] vs international
medical graduates [IMGs]), length of time since graduation and practice setting, it appears that practice setting—those
in academic practice compared to those in a group practice—is a major factor influencing educational pathways,
current practice characteristics and satisfaction. The following are key findings related to the differences between
nephrologists in academic practice and those in group practice.
*An equal number of respondents were working in group practices and academic settings. Early practice
female nephrologists are more likely to practice in academic settings than group practice settings (53.8% to
38.7%). Early practice male nephrologists, on the other hand, are less likely to practice in academic settings
and more likely to practice in group settings (42.4% to 52.9%).

#### Exhibit A1: Setting of Primary Nephrology Job by Gender

```{r exhibit-a1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-a1.png"))
```

* Similarly, USMGs among the early practice nephrologists are more likely to practice in academic settings than
group practice (50.8% to 43.5%) while IMG early practice nephrologists are less likely to practice in academic
settings and more likely to practice in groups (43.8% to 50.4%).
* Academic practitioners are far more likely to have had 3 or more years of nephrology fellowship training than
group practice nephrologists (48.4% to 14%). Academic physicians are more likely to have had additional
training in clinical research (37.4% vs. 16.3%); basic science research (19.8% vs. 14%); and transplant
nephrology (31.9% vs. 20.9%). Group practice nephrologists were more likely to have had training in
interventional nephrology (20.9% to 4.4%) and palliative care (9.3% to 4.4%).

#### Exhibit A2: Setting of Primary Nephrology Job by Total Years Training Completed, Academic and Group Practice Only

```{r exhibit-a2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-a2.png"))
```

* Both academic and group practice nephrologists were generally satisfied with their education and training with
only 3.3% of each group expressing any dissatisfaction.  
* Not surprising, academic nephrologists were far more likely to focus on transplant than group practice
nephrologists (21.3% to 3.3%). The majority of nephrologists practice general nephrology only: 85.2% of the
group practice nephrologists and 65.6% of the academic nephrologists.
* By far the most common job responsibilities were care of hospitalized patients (96.1% of respondents), care
of patients in the clinic (93.8%) and care of patients in an outpatient dialysis unit (78.7%). Those in academic
practices were more likely than those in group practices to have responsibility for kidney biopsies (48.4% vs.
9.1%), dialysis catheter placement (34.4% vs. 19.8%) and clinical research (57.4% vs. 8.3%), while those in group
practices were more likely than those in academic practices to have responsibility for care of patients in an
outpatient dialysis unit (90.1% vs. 69.7%) or in a nursing home or rehabilitation unit (34.8% vs. 22.5%) or to hold
a medical directorship with a dialysis provider (33.9% vs. 15.6%).

#### Exhibit A3: Responsibilities in Primary Nephrology Job by Group or Academic Practice Setting

```{r exhibit-a3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-a3.png"))
```

* As would be expected, the vast majority of group practice nephrologists have a path to partnership (77%), while
this is rare for those in academic practice (5.7%).
* Group practice nephrologists work far more patient care hours per week than academic nephrologists:
57.4% of group nephrologists provided 50 or more hours of patient care per week compared to 16.5% of
academic nephrologists. Academic nephrologists provided more hours per week on research than group
practice nephrologists.

#### Exhibit A4: Time Spent in Patient Care by Group or Academic Practice Setting

```{r exhibit-a4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-a4.png"))
```

* In general, nephrologists working in group practices received more incentives to join their current practice
compared to academic nephrologists including: sign-on bonuses (28% to 5.1%); income guarantees (33.1% to
16.9%); relocation allowance (34.7% to 20.3%); support for MOC preparation (53.4% to 40.7%); and J-1 visa
waivers (6.6% to 3.4%). On the other hand, academic physicians were more likely to receive support for career
development opportunities (37.3% to 16.9%); H-1 Visa sponsorships (18.6% to 13.6%); and on-call payments
(5.9% to 2.5%).
* Group practice nephrologists have far more evening and weekend call responsibilities: 60.6% of group practice
nephrologists had weekend call 13 times or more in a year while only 24.1% of academic nephrologists had
13 or more; and 39.1% of group practice nephrologists had night call 26 or more weeks compared to 18.1% of
academic nephrologists.

#### Exhibit A5: Number of Weekends on Call Annually by Group or Academic Practice Setting

```{r exhibit-a5, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-a5.png"))
```


#### Exhibit A6: Number of Weeks with Night Calls Annually by Group or Academic Practice Setting

```{r exhibit-a6, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-a6.png"))
```

* While nephrologists generally provide a set of core services regardless of setting, there are some notable
differences in regard to specific procedures. For example, 61.1% of academic nephrologists provided CRRT to
5 or more patients per month, yet, only 31% of group practice nephrologists provided that level of procedures.
Only 12.3% of group physicians performed any kidney biopsies in a typical month compared to 60.9% of
the academic nephrologists. Only 35.7% of group nephrologists performed any temporary dialysis catheter
placement in a month compared to 61.4% of the academic nephrologists; and academic nephrologists were
more than 4 times as likely to perform a renal ultrasound in a month as group nephrologists (16.7% vs. 3.5%).

#### Exhibit A7: Frequency Common Procedures Were Performed by Group or Academic Practice Setting

```{r exhibit-a7.1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-a7.1.png"))
```

```{r exhibit-a7.2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-a7.2.png"))
```

* There was a significant difference in income by setting, with group practice nephrologists earning an annual
mean income $30,000 higher than 
academic physicians (mean incomes $207,176 vs. 
$176,438). The difference
was greatest for males, with male group practice nephrologists making nearly $40,000 more per year than male
academic nephrologists ($220,479 vs. 
$180,952). The difference for females was a little 
more than $9,000.
* When viewed by gender, males were making nearly $31,000 more than females 
(mean incomes $206,043
vs. $176,152). The difference was far greater in group 
practice ($41,050; 
$220,479 for males vs. 
$179,429 for
females) than in academic positions ($10,629; 
$180,952 vs. 
$170,323).

#### Exhibit A8: Mean Base Salary by Sex and Setting of Primary Nephrology Job

```{r exhibit-a8, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-a8.png"))
```

* IMGs in group practices reported earning $6,500 more than USMGs in group 
practices ($210,000 vs
$203,404). However, USMGs in academic settings make 
nearly $20,000 more than IMGs in that setting
($189,483 vs 
$168,000)
* Despite the great variation between the incomes of nephrologists in group practice and academic
institutions, their satisfaction with their income is similar. Overall, a quarter of nephrologists were
dissatisfied with their income.
* Both group practice and academic nephrologists were satisfied or very satisfied with the intellectual challenges
(92.6% and 93.3% respectively) and with their relationships with patients (91% and 94.5% respectively). These
were clearly some of the key reasons for selecting the specialty and undoubtedly contributed to the general
satisfaction with their current position.

#### Exhibit A9: Ratings of Aspects of Nephrology

```{r exhibit-a9, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-a9.png"))
```

* Overall, 11.6% were dissatisfied with the current position, with similar percentages for group and academic
nephrologists.
* On the other hand, work hours and ability to balance work-life needs are challenges in nephrology especially
in group practice: 35% of group practice nephrologists had a negative opinion of hours worked compared
to 23.5% of academic nephrologists; and 33.6% of group practice nephrologists were dissatisfied with their
work-life balance compared to 26.1% of the academic nephrologists.
* Many group practice nephrologists were also dissatisfied with job opportunities in nephrology (38.5%); this was
also an issue for academic nephrologists but to a lesser extent (23.7% dissatisfied).
* The difference in satisfaction between the group and academic nephrologists comes out in their willingness to
recommend the specialty to medical students and residents: 81% of academic physicians would recommend
the specialty compared to 69.7% of group practice nephrologists.

#### Exhibit A10: Would Recommend Nephrology to Medical Students and Residents, by Group or Academic Practice Setting

```{r exhibit-a10, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-a10.png"))
```

## Methods

The target group for the survey was nephrology fellows who graduated during the period 2012–2015 and had therefore
been in practice for at least one year. ASN provided GW-HWI with 2934 email addresses of nephrologists believed to
have completed training in that period. GW-HWI utilized REDCap survey software for emailing a unique survey web link
to each potential participant. The survey launched in late May 2017 and closed after five weeks with 320 valid responses
for a response rate of 10.9%.  

During data cleaning it was found that a number of respondents had completed their fellowship outside the target year
range, including 2016 graduates. Given the relatively low response rate and noting that most 2016 graduates would
likely have a full year’s practice experience behind them and therefore could provide useful data about post-training
practice, it was decided to extend the year range for completing core nephrology training to 2009–2016 but to exclude
those outside this range. Ten respondents who did not provide their year of completing training were also included, in
the expectation that they were far more likely than not to fall within the year range of interest given the method by which
individuals were selected for the survey.  

A decision was made to exclude pediatric nephrologists; taken together with data cleaning this left a total of 270
respondents for the analysis. Exhibit 1 lists the responses by year of completing core training.  


#### Exhibit 1: Year of Completing Core Nephrology Training

```{r exhibit-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-1.png"))
```


As the exhibit shows, respondents’ years of completing nephrology training ranged from 2009 to 2016, which is
consistent with the target group being 2012–2015 new practitioners, some of whom were continuing with extra training
following core nephrology training before beginning practice.  

#### Exhibit 2: Responding by Total Years of Nephrology Training

```{r exhibit-2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-2.png"))
```

More than two-thirds of respondents (68.8%, Exhibit 2) completed their nephrology training in 2 years though a
substantial minority spent 3 or more years in training.

## Representativeness

Comparison with ACGME data from 2013–2014 and 2015–2016 suggests that respondents to the Early Practice Survey
had a higher proportion of females (by around 5%) and a lower proportion of IMGs (by around 10–12%) than the likely
population of nephrologists who completed training in recent years. Proportions of Black/African Americans and
Hispanics/Latinos were, very roughly, in line with the expected population.

#### Exhibit 3: Profile of Respondents

```{r exhibit-3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-3.png"))
```

## Educational and Demographic Background

#### Exhibit 4: Medical School Location

```{r exhibit-4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-4.png"))
```


#### Exhibit 5: Citizenship Status

```{r exhibit-5, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-5.png"))
```

More than half of respondents were U.S. citizens, either native born (40.8%) or naturalized (20.2%). Around one-quarter
were on temporary visas, either temporary worker (H, 20.2%) or exchange visitor (J, 3.4%) visas. It is unclear why any
practicing nephrologists would be on exchange visitor visas, though it is possible these were former J visa holders
working in HPSAs under one of the various J visa waiver schemes. (Technically, waiver holders transfer to H-1B visas,
but it is possible some are unaware of this change in visa status. GW-HWI has agreed with ASN to conduct interviews
during 2018 to explore this and similar questions about visa status awareness.)  

IMG respondents were more likely than USMGs to be male (66.4% vs. 47.5% male respectively, Exhibit 6).

#### Exhibit 6: Sex of Respondents by IMG Status

```{r exhibit-6, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-6.png"))
```

## Academic Practice vs. Private Practice

An analysis of the survey responses indicated that there were significant differences on numerous variables between
nephrologists who had gone into academic practice compared to those who went into private practice. For that
reason, this report includes numerous exhibits comparing nephrologists who are in group practice to those that are in
academic practices.

#### Exhibit 7: Setting of Primary Nephrology Job by Sex

```{r exhibit-7, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-7.png"))
```

As indicated in Exhibit 7, 47.1% of the respondents went into group practice and 47.1% into academic practice. Also, as
indicated in the exhibit, females were more likely to go into academic practice than group practice (53% to 39%), while
males were more likely to go into group practice (53% to 42%).  

As indicated in Exhibit 8, USMGs were more likely to enter academic practices than group practices (51% to 43.5%),
while IMGs were more likely to enter group practices (50% to 44%).

#### Exhibit 8: Setting of Primary Nephrology Job by Medical School Type

```{r exhibit-8, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-8.png"))
```


It appears that as a nephrologist advances through their early career they move away from group practice and towards
academic practice (Exhibit 9), with the percentage in group practice at 56.7% among those who completed core training
in the past two years but only 32.6% among those who completed training in 2012 or earlier; conversely, the percentage
in academic practices is almost double among those who completed training in 2012 or earlier compared to those
completing training in 2015 or 2016 (67.4% vs. 34.2%). It is also possible that the 2011–2012 cohort entered practice at a
time when there happened to be opportunities in academic practice.  

#### Exhibit 9: Setting of Primary Nephrology Job by Year Core Training Completed

```{r exhibit-9, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-9.png"))
```

As might be expected, those working in academic practices typically spent more years in nephrology training
than those working in group practices (Exhibit 10). Almost twice as many of those with only two years of training
were working in group practices as in academic practices (62.3% vs. 37.7%), with the proportions being more than
reversed for those with three years of training; only one of the 17 with four or more years of training was working in a
group practice.  

#### Exhibit 10: Setting of Primary Nephrology Job by Total Years Training Completed, Academic and Group Practices Only

```{r exhibit-10, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-10.png"))
```

## Practice and Focus Activities

More than half (55.8%) of respondents indicated they had taken additional training following completion of core
nephrology training (Exhibit 11). The most common additional trainings undertaken were clinical research (29.3% of
respondents who answered any part of this question), transplant nephrology (27.3%), basic science research (18.0%),
and interventional nephrology (10.0%). Among the 18 others, 2 (1.4%) cited clinical ethics training, two cited glomerular
disease and two mentioned medical education.

#### Exhibit 11: Additional Training After Completion of Core Nephrology Training

```{r exhibit-11, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-11.png"))
```

There were some substantial differences in training patterns depending on practice setting in either group practice or
academic practice, as seen in Exhibit 12. For example, more than twice as many of the respondents from academic
practices had had training in clinical research compared to those in group practices (37.4% vs. 16.3%), and one
and a half times as many had had training in transplant nephrology (31.9% vs. 20.9%); conversely, far more of the
respondents from group practices had undergone training in interventional nephrology (20.9% vs. 4.4% of those from
academic practice).

#### Exhibit 12: Additional Training After Completion of Core Nephrology Training, by Group or Academic Practice Setting

```{r exhibit-12, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-12.png"))
```

#### Exhibit 13: Focus of Primary Nephrology Job

```{r exhibit-13, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-13.png"))
```

Almost three-quarters of respondents (72.2%) said their primary work focus was general nephrology (Exhibit 13). The
only other notable responses were transplant nephrology (11.9%) and mixed nephrology plus another clinical specialty
area (8.8%). USMGs were more likely than IMGs to focus on general nephrology (79.7% vs. 66.0%) but less likely than
IMGs to work in transplant nephrology (8.1% vs. 15.0%). Only 9 (3.3%) were not primarily focused on nephrology.

#### Exhibit 14: Focus of Primary Nephrology Job by Group or Academic Practice Setting

```{r exhibit-14, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-14.png"))
```

Exhibit 14 shows that those whose focus was general nephrology were more likely to be in group practice than
academic practice settings (85.2% vs. 65.6%), while those whose focus was transplant nephrology were more likely to
be in academic than group practice settings (21.3% vs. 3.3%).  

By far the most common job responsibilities were care of hospitalized patients (97.1% of respondents), care of
patients in the clinic (94.7%) and care of patients in an outpatient dialysis unit (79.8%), as seen in Exhibit 15. Other
responsibilities exercised by more than 10% of respondents were clinical research (32.9%), kidney biopsy (28.8%),
dialysis catheter placement (27.2%), medical directorship with a dialysis provider (24.7%) and care of patients in a
nursing home or rehabilitation center (18.1%).

#### Exhibit 15: Responsibilities in Primary Nephrology Job by Group or Academic Practice Setting

```{r exhibit-15, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-15.png"))
```

Also from Exhibit 15, those in academic practices were more likely than those in group practices to have responsibility
for kidney biopsies (48.4% vs. 9.1%), dialysis catheter placement (34.4% vs. 19.8%) and clinical research (57.4% vs.
8.3%), while those in group practices were more likely than those in academic practices to have responsibility for care of
patients in an outpatient dialysis unit (90.1% vs. 69.7%) or in a nursing home or rehabilitation unit (24.8% vs. 11.5%) or to
hold a medical directorship with a dialysis provider (33.9% vs. 15.6%).

#### Exhibit 16: Partnership Opportunities

```{r exhibit-16, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-16.png"))
```

Not surprisingly, the vast majority of nephrologists in group practice (77%) said their primary job offered them a path to
partnership; only 5.7% of those in other settings said they had a path to partnership (Exhibit 16).

#### Exhibit 17: Primary Job Path to Partnership by Medical School Graduation Status

```{r exhibit-17, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-17.png"))
```

IMGs were more likely than USMGs to have a path to partnership (42.0% vs. 36.9%), likely because a higher proportion of
IMGs than USMGs were in group practice.  

Overall, 10.8% answered that they were already a partner (Exhibit 18).  

#### Exhibit 18: Whether or Not Partner

```{r exhibit-18, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-19.png"))
```

Over 60% of respondents reported spending at least 40 hours per week in patient care, with another 17.3% spending at
least 30 hours weekly (Exhibit 19).  

#### Exhibit 20: Time Spent in Patient Care by Group or Academic Practice Setting

Respondents working in group practices were spending more time in patient care than those in academic practices,
with 47.1% of them reporting 50+ hours a week of patient care compared to 13.6% of those in academic practices
(Exhibit 20).

#### Exhibit 21: Incentives Received, by Group or Academic Practice Setting

```{r exhibit-21, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-21.png"))
```

The most common incentives reported were support for maintenance of certification and continuing medical education
(47.0%), relocation allowances (27.5%), career development opportunities (27.1%), income guarantees (25.0%), sign-on
bonus (16.5%) and H-1 visa sponsorship (16.1%). Fewer than one in four (21.6%) reported no incentives. Of the 14
respondents who described ‘other’ types of incentive, 5 cited some kind of performance or productivity bonus and 2
more cited an annual bonus without saying how this was assessed.  

Respondents from group practices were more likely than those from academic practices to report receiving support
for maintenance of certification and continuing medical education (53.4% vs. 40.7%), relocation allowances (34.7% vs.
20.3%), income guarantees (33.1% vs. 16.9%) and a sign-on bonus (28.0% vs. 5.1%). Those in academic practices were
more likely than those in group practices to report receiving career development opportunities (37.3% vs. 16.9%) and
H-1 visa sponsorship (18.6% vs. 13.6%).

## Evening and Weekend Responsibilities

#### Exhibit 22: Number of Weekends on Call Annually

```{r exhibit-22, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-22.png"))
```

Only one in ten respondents (10.5%) were on call every other weekend or more, but 32.9% more were on call at least
every fourth weekend. Most respondents (48.4%) were on call at least once every two months but less often than every
fourth weekend. The proportion on call at least every other weekend decreased as the number of years out of training
increased, with the proportion on call at least one weekend in two being 12.8% among those completing training in
2015 and 2016 compared to 4.1% among those completing training in 2012 or earlier. A corresponding change in those
on call from 6 to 12 weekends annually suggests a general trend towards a lower on-call frequency as the nephrologist
career progresses.

#### Exhibit 23: Number of Weeks with Night Calls Annually, by Year of Completing Training

```{r exhibit-23, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-23.png"))
```

More respondents were on night call at least every other week than were on call every other weekend (29.7% vs. 10.5%)
but, as with weekends on call, the largest group were on night call at least once every two months but less than every
fourth weekend (31.7%).  

As with weekends on call, a general trend is evident towards a lower frequency of weeks with night calls as the
nephrologist career progresses, with 27.7% of those completing training in 2015 and 2016 on night call at least every
other week compared to 14.6% of those completing training in 2012 or earlier.  

How far these trends toward reduced out-of-hours responsibilities as the nephrologist’s career progresses are
explained by the switch from group practices to academic practices is unknown, but as Exhibits 24 and 25 show, those
in academic practices are generally on call and on night-call less often than those in group practices: only 24.1% of
respondents in academic practices reported being on call 13 or more weekends annually compared to 63.6% of those
in group practices, while only 41.4% of respondents in academic practices reported 13 or more weekends on night call
annually compared to 65.2% of those in group practices.

## Procedural Responsibilities

#### Exhibit 26: Dialysis Modalities Offered in Primary Nephrology Job

```{r exhibit-26, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-26.png"))
```

The most common dialysis modalities offered were in-center conventional (99.6% of respondents), home PD (85.1%)
and home HD (64.1%), with in-center nocturnal much less common (29.0%).

#### Exhibit 27: Frequency Common Procedures Were Performed

CRRT was the most frequently performed procedure and only 15% of respondents did not perform CRRT;
temporary dialysis catheter placement was performed by 48.3% of respondents and kidney biopsy by 46.3%. Renal
ultrasonography, tunneled catheter placement and PD catheter placement were all performed relatively infrequently.

#### Exhibit 28: Frequency Common Procedures Were Performed, by Group or Academic Practice Setting

```{r exhibit-28.1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-28.1.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-28.2.png"))
```

In general, those in academic practices were more likely than those in group practices to report performing procedures
such as CRRT, temporary dialysis catheter placement and kidney biopsy (Exhibit 28).

## Salaries

#### Exhibit 29: Base Salary (Mean) by Medical School Graduation Status and Sex

```{r exhibit-29, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-29.png"))
```

Mean income (based on midpoints of $10,000 ranges) indicates that males were 
earning around $30,000 more on
average than females, while there was little overall difference between USMG and IMG average salaries (Exhibit
29). The median salary, which is less sensitive to outliers, told a similar story, with the overall median in the range
$180,000-
$189,999 and male and female median salaries around 
$20,000 apart.

#### Exhibit 30: Mean Base Salary by Setting of Primary Nephrology Job


```{r exhibit-30, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-30.png"))
```

Exhibit 30 indicates that nephrologists in group practices were earning more than those in academic practices, as
can be seen by differences of around $25,000 in exclusively nephrology group vs. academic practices and more
than $60,000 in multispecialty group vs. academic practices. The highest earnings were reported by those in solo
practices ($235,000) though with only two respondents in this category this result may not be representative. Five of
the respondents included among the ‘other’ settings reported being based in hospitals (excluding one based in a VA
hospital), with average earnings of $221,000, roughly comparable with earnings at multispecialty group practices.

#### Exhibit 31: Mean Base Salary by Sex and Setting of Primary Nephrology Job

```{r exhibit-31, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-31.png"))
```

Splitting the salary data by sex and contrasting group with academic practices (Exhibit 31) reveals a pattern of males
earning more than females in both types of setting, but with a much bigger male-female differential in group practices
($41,000) than in academic practices 
(around $10,500).  

The pattern is less clear, but still evident, when comparing median salaries (Exhibit 32).

#### Exhibit 32: Median Base Salary by Sex and Setting of Primary Nephrology Job

```{r exhibit-32, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-32.png"))
```

#### Exhibit 33: Mean Base Salary by Group or Academic Practice Setting and Medical School Graduation Status

```{r exhibit-33, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-33.png"))
```

IMGs reported higher salaries than USMGs in group practices (by about $5,500) but lower salaries than USMGs in
academic practices by more than $20,000 (Exhibit 33). This presents a somewhat different story to the apparent overall
similarity of IMG and USMG salaries reported above in Exhibit 29. The pattern is similar but less pronounced in median
salaries (Exhibit 34).

#### Exhibit 34: Median Base Salary by Group or Academic Practice Setting and Medical School
Graduation Status

```{r exhibit-34, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-34.png"))
```

#### Exhibit 35: Mean and Median Base Salary by Practice Focus

```{r exhibit-35, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-35.png"))
```

Transplant nephrology and general nephrology were the highest paid branches of nephrology ($192,000 and 
$189,699
respectively), with general nephrology far and away the most common focus reported (73.8% of respondents who
supplied salary information on their primary nephrology job). Nephrology-focused hospitalists and interventional
nephrologists reported the lowest salaries though the numbers involved were small, amounting together to only 4% of
the respondents. Median salaries told a similar story.

#### Exhibit 36: Mean Base Salary by Year of Completing Core Nephrology Training

```{r exhibit-36, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-36.png"))
```

Perhaps surprisingly, it was respondents who had completed core nephrology training in 2012 or earlier who reported
the lowest salaries, more than $10,000 less on average than those who completed training later. This is most likely a
consequence of the higher proportion in academic practices, where reported earnings are substantially less than in
group practices.

#### Exhibit 37: Distribution of Incentive Income

```{r exhibit-37, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-37.png"))
```

Just over 60% of respondents reported some incentive income, though only about a third overall (34.5%) reported
incentive income above $10,000 annually. Only one in five (20.3%) reported 
incentive income above $25,000 but with
about half of this group (10.2% of all respondents) reporting incentive income greater than $50,000.

## Satisfaction

#### Exhibit 38: Satisfaction with Nephrology Training

```{r exhibit-38, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-38.png"))
```

While only a few nephrologists were dissatisfied with their nephrology training, only a bare majority of respondents
(50.7%) were very satisfied, with USMGs a little more satisfied than IMGs (54.5% vs. 47.6% very satisfied respectively)
and males a little more satisfied than females (53.5% vs. 47.8% very satisfied); a larger majority (62.5%) still strongly
agreed that they were adequately prepared for nephrology practice by the end of their fellowship and only one
respondent (0.4%) said they did not agree they were adequately prepared for practice. Differences in nephrology
training satisfaction according to practice setting were not significant.

#### Exhibit 39: Satisfaction with Overall Salary/Compensation for USMGs and IMGs

```{r exhibit-39, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-39.png"))
```

USMGs were much more likely to report being very satisfied with their overall salary than IMGs (28.1% vs. 12.2%), while
IMGs were more likely to be very dissatisfied than USMGs (10.2% vs. 6.6%).

#### Exhibit 40: Satisfaction with Overall Salary/Compensation by Group or Academic Practice Setting

```{r exhibit-40, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-40.png"))
```

There were no significant differences in satisfaction with overall salary/compensation between group and academic
practice settings (Exhibit 40).

#### Exhibit 41: Satisfaction with Overall Salary/Compensation

```{r exhibit-41, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("03_reports", "05_Early-Career-Nephrologists-Survey-Figs/exhibit-41.png"))
```

Satisfaction with compensation was highest among those who completed training in 2013 and 2014, with 70.5%
satisfied or very satisfied with compensation compared to 62.4% of those completing training in 2015 and 2016.
Only 49% of those completing training in 2012 or earlier were satisfied with compensation, likely reflecting the higher
proportion in academic settings where earnings are lower than in group practices.

```

Respondents were very positive indeed about the quality of patient relationships and intellectual challenges in
nephrology (93.2% and 92.5% positive or very positive respectively). They were least positive about administrative
duties (30.2%), geographical job distribution (33.2%) and job opportunities (34%).

```

Using a satisfaction index obtained by awarding scores from -100 to +100 based on responses, respondents from
academic practices were more satisfied than those from group practices in regard to patient relationships (satisfaction
index of 79.3 vs. 70.1), number of hours worked (13.9 vs. 2.5), work-life balance (12.6 vs. 0.4), job opportunities (9.3 vs.
-5.4) and geographic distribution of jobs (4.6 vs. -2.5). Satisfaction on intellectual challenge and administrative duties
was about the same in both groups.  

Respondents in academic practices were also more satisfied than those in group practices with their current position
(41.3% very satisfied vs. 33.1%). Overall almost 80% were somewhat or very satisfied with their current positions.  

#### Exhibit 44: Satisfaction with Current Position

```

Despite the high level of personal satisfaction with some aspects of nephrology, a quarter of respondents did not feel
they could recommend nephrology to current medical students and residents, with respondents from academic practices
more likely than those from group practices to recommend nephrology to medical students and residents (81% vs.
69.7%, Exhibit 45). USMGs were more likely than IMGs to recommend nephrology (77.7% vs. 72.1%, Exhibit 46).

```

Respondents who completed training at least three years ago were more positive about recommending nephrology to
medical students and residents (76.8% and 77.6% compared to 70.9%).

## Reasons for Recommending

Many respondents cited the challenge, intellectual stimulation and variety/interest of the field. Though some were
concerned about low pay and poor work-life balance, the extent of concern about these issues varied depending on
the particular position held by the respondent. Many of the respondents saw in nephrology a more traditional physician
role with close doctor-patient relationships, the stimulation of varied practice challenges, and the vocational rewards
attendant on improving patients’ lives.  

* My love for nephrology makes it hard for me to
understand why there is lack of interest in this field. It
offers deep understanding of physiology, offers variety
of paths including transplant, dialysis including home
modalities, Glomerular diseases, stones, acute/critical
care, Onconephrology , interventional etc. There is no
lack of job opportunities either and life style is decent.
* Nephrology - when practised in all its diversity, has a
wide spectrum of problems, techniques and modalities
to understand and use. From diseases as common
as just HTN and diabetes all the way to complex
autoimmune conditions, it mandates that the practitioner
be an excellent internist, good with hands on skills and
good with just business sense. Finally, with nephro,
balancing your regular life out can be easier as compared
to other fields. The remuneration is satisfactory in the
long run.
* Nephrology is certainly disappointing when it comes
to compensation. However, it’s extremely interesting
and mentally challenging medical specialty. If you like
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, you will enjoy the
specialty.
* Nephrology is the closest thing to traditional Internal
Medicine practice. We develop relationships with
our patients and see them in both the inpatient and
outpatient setting. It is extremely rewarding. Nephrology
is challenging and never dull. In academic nephrology I
have had the opportunity to focus on what interests me
the most and continue to improve nephrology practice
through research.
* Promotes critical thinking, care of the whole patient,
challenging, rewarding, Long term patient physician
relationships
* There is a good mix of inpatient and outpatient care as
well as variety to your day with rounding at the dialysis
units. Of the inpatient consults, there is a mix of routine
and critically ill patients. You are able to both see your
impact over time as well as your impact within just a few
hours once a patient’s labs or clinical status improves.
* It remains to be a very interesting subspecialty of
medicine and very challenging. It provides many
opportunities to impact patients’ lives for the better
* Interesting pathophysiology, good schedule, lots of
teaching opportunities in academic practice, potential for
research.
* I enjoy long term care of patients. I like the diversity of
disease processes that I deal with on a day to day basis.
The changing clinical settings that negotiate in a week
including inpatient, outpatient, dialysis units keeps me
engaged.
* Despite flaws in the specialty, I still find it to be very
rewarding for the reasons I chose it as a specialty.
I enjoy the complicated patients along with the
investigative work it takes to determine cause of their
kidney related diagnosis. It’s fun to think about the
physiology and how that explains a patient’s renal or
fluid/electrolyte/acid base abnormality. There is a lot of
flexibility in the specialty in terms of hospital based work
vs outpatient work. Nephrologists generally can find a
position that fits with their interests and lifestyle.
* An aspect medicine I find very relevant and interesting.
A nephrologist is specialist but still somewhat involved in
the general care/overview of the patient.

## Reasons for Not Recommending

The reasons respondents gave for not recommending nephrology appeared to represent a difference in weighting
between the positive and negative aspects of the profession, with each nephrologist weighing things differently
according to the interests, sense of personal reward, and the position they held. Although the negatives included
high workload and low pay, many of the responses regarded these as impacted significantly by practices themselves
and reflected on the vulnerability of new nephrologists entering the field to unfair contract terms. In addition, some
negatives (such as having to care almost single-handedly for a critically ill patient) would be regarded as positives by
nephrologists who valued the more traditional physician role exemplified by such a case.  

* I like the pathophysiology very much and highly
interested but I will NOT recommend them nephrology
because private practices are NOT honest and fair to
their juniors associates in terms of partnership track and
incentives. There is literally no security in the practices
that you will get the right partnership track in the end.
Low salary to begin with poor incentives. There is a lot of
dishonesty in this specialty in terms of honesty among
the private practices. I heard lot of cases that after 3 or 5
years of practices, practices do not offer the partnership
track. Good friends of mine, who came to this specialty
because of me, joined the hospitalist once done with
their fellowships due to above stories. That’s the main
reason people are leaving the nephrology and entering
into hospitalist jobs. There is a good security and
incentives in hospitalist job and more time to your family.
I would like to recommend to students and residents but
they stated me above reasons. That’s why they do not
want to join the nephrology specialty. We need to fix this
above main issue. The other main issue is visa for foreign
graduates. Not many IMG, getting into residency training
due to visa issues.
* Lifestyle limiting in small practice, frequency of call
and hours worked, including on call return to hospital
requirements, moderate compensation for time requires.
* After 3 years of private practice as an associate
nephrologist in [state], I resigned from my first
Nephrology job since graduation due to an unfavorable
partnership contract. I would caution residents
with interest in Nephrology about the hostility to
new graduates in the [state] area with relation to its
competitiveness and also high risk of being taken
advantage of. Private practice Nephrology is very work
intensive, and the [state] area is saturated. I would
caution that the partner level salary is barely higher than
that of Hospitalist, which is one reason why my current
job is a Nocturnist. I may return to Nephrology in the
future if the contract is fair or favorable.
* Although I love practicing what I do, and that is the
reason I have continued practice in nephrology for
last 5 years, despite many newer job opportunities
(e.g. hospitalist, work from home- as peer reviewer
with insurance companies, etc.); this branch sets you
up for very long and busy work days, lots and lots of
commute to get to various satellite dialysis clinics and
outpatient/ CKD clinics, very poor reimbursement ( I
am being paid much lower than a fresh family medicine
graduate at the same practice despite much higher
patient volume and wRVUS!!!), no time or mentorship
for career advancement due to many responsibilities;
and thus, a very high rate of burnout. I would hate
for any enthusiastic student or resident have to make
tough decisions like the ones I am faced with, so early
in their career.
* Getting a good nephrology practice is difficult these
days. Most practice never keep their promises and
overwork newly employed nephrologist.
* I love nephrology itself, but the job market is very
draining on a nephrology physician and I don’t think the
specialty is recognized as well for the care we provide. I
do believe the nephrology community itself is responsible
for this situation. We haven’t promoted ourselves as
aggressively as we should have so far.
* Not enough compensation for the workload
transportation time and responsibilities required A
better quality of life could be had as a hospitalist with
an interest in nephrology. The field is misunderstood by
Business and therefore the important and mentally time
consuming work is undervalued and our productivity is
undervalued based on the lack of billable procedures.
Many become burned out by the realities of the field at
this time and therefore while I could encourage someone
with an interest already but at the same time I would
encourage them to make an informed decision which
was in fact the same advice I was offered before I went
to fellowship.
* Not all nephrologists compensated appropriately for the
amount of work and involvement of our patients. Part
time options are not really part time and people complain
that they end up working full time for part time pay.
* The field isn’t what I joined it for. I joined for the
opportunity to take care of seriously ill patients with
interesting physiology; what I got was essentially
preventative care with CKD, non-nephrologists having
little respect for our opinion on critically ill patients, and
a terrible salary-to-work ratio. To top it off, we’re losing
turf to other providers. The current fellowship crisis
stems from people seeing how miserable our situation is.
Despite how much I love nephrology, critical care offers
better opportunities for the ICU-inclined, and rheum
offers better opportunities for interesting outpatient care
with a better salary. I likely would still choose nephrology
for myself, but cannot in good conscience recommend
the mess that the specialty is to others right now unless
they have a specific kidney research bent or some other
factor that outweighs our issues.

## What ASN Can Do To Support Careers in Nephrology

Responses fell into three main categories:  

1. Lobbying & Advocacy, mainly around pay and reimbursement but also for immigration issues,
for defending the role of the nephrologist  

* Dramatically reduce the number of nephrology fellowship
so the demand and supply ratio is balanced. Reduce
regulations faced by kidney transplant programs. Reduce
regulations faced by dialysis units so that it is easier for a
nephrologist to own dialysis units.
* We have a shortage of people going into Nephrology and
a large burnout rate (especially in private practice). I think
that improving reimbursement in Nephrology is key to
recruitment of future Nephrologists. It is a tough job with
a lot of call/weekend responsibilities. It is disheartening
to see that the reimbursement for a starting Nephrologist
is less than a hospitalist, especially given the difference
in work hours.
* Intensified lobbying efforts for enhanced reimbursement
* Lobby for better compensation for the care we do,
working to re-establish our role in nephrology care issues
like diagnostic procedures or interventional procedures.
* By highlighting the practices in US that are abusing
budding nephrologist on visa
* Do a better job of explaining to Congress the need for J1/
H1 visas for nephrologists since a very high proportion of
the physicians in this field are on waivers and they face a
lot of trouble with regards to immigration. That coupled
with a low paying job is driving a lot of IM residents to
go for hospitalist jobs. Need to offer varied educational
programs at ASN, geared not only to fellows (clinical
education) but also those aimed towards people in
practice (QI, business aspects of the field, etc.)
* Not quite sure how ASN can be of help. More employers
having idea about visa sponsorship needing professionals
like me would help finding a good place to work.
* Please save nephrology as a specialty, by maintaining
higher standards for nephrology fellowships,
limiting newer nephrology fellowship programs, and
stemming the oversupply of (sometimes inadequately
trained) nephrology applicants into a market with
limited job opportunities.

2. Education, including appreciation of educational
opportunities provided already by ASN  

* Continue great educational opportunities such as neph sap
* Continued grant support Continued offering of CME
materials such as NephSAP and special CJASN series
(physiology, glomerular disease etc)
* I appreciate the educational content and funding
opportunities that ASN provides.
* More opportunities to appreciate the complexity
of medical billing and the business of medicine,
specifically nephrology.

3. Support and Mentoring in Job Search and
Contract Negotiations, as nephrologists move into
their first practice positions  

* ASN needs to work with private practices to mandate
them to have high base salary and have a structured
contract for partnership track. In this way, the new
comer feel more secure. I am wondering if we do not
work on above then this wonderful and pivotal specialty
will be obsolete.
* Continue to offer resources connecting young
nephrologists with mentors in the field. Encourage
training programs to expand the scope of training/
teaching; identify and enable the programs that are
training future leaders with expanded skill sets.
* Continue to work to support women in the field by
continuing support networks and trying to create an
atmosphere of full disclosure (as to fair pay to disclose
the salary discrepancies that arise between men and
women in the same job fields with the same experience)
* Fellows need to learn about the business of nephrology.
Unfortunately, there are many practices where physicians
take advantage of the lack of knowledge of the business
of nephrology recently graduated fellows have.
* Find ways to guide those early in their careers to
make the best of this profession, given the increasing
regulations and less than ideal compensation.
* I would have liked some guidance when I was looking for
a job. My mentors in an academic setting couldn’t help.
I would have liked to ask about - How many hospitals
rounding at - How much windshield time - How does
weekend coverage work I would have liked a better
understanding about the loss of work life balance and
would have liked to know what I was sacrificing when I
took on my first job.
* Set up some kind of network for graduating fellows to
find jobs more easily. Right now, it’s all by word of mouth.
* mentorship programs are important and helpful. I had
tremendous mentors in fellowship I hope all young
nephrologists have this opportunity

4. Other  

* I think it will be difficult as most of the issue is a problem
related to the market (salary, for life style just is not there
bottom line). ASN is a great academic resource though.
* Advocate strongly for policy changes to better support
not only research but care for renal patients. More
nephrology training and exposure at student and
resident level. Aggressive promotion of the importance
of specialty. The above will lead to increased
recognition of renal problems, of the importance of
nephrology care, and hopefully progression to early
intervention programs. I am aware that ASN is actively
involved in above currently.


## What ASN Can Do To Support Efforts To Offer The Best Quality Care

1. Educational activities, often with a plea for low
cost or nil cost materials:  

* ASN is doing a great job with the educational
resources and i hope you keep up the great work.
getting input of fresh graduates in practice would
provide insight as well.
* Training on different aspects on nephrology- like
coding, Medical directorship role and responsibilities.
Continuing to provide online modules - if possible
in video format for CME. Ongoing CME. Perhaps
pod-casts/educational courses that could be taken
online for CME. Similar to the Board Review Course
but with modules and not just content experts but
actual medical educators providing the content to
ensure it’s educational.
* Including KSAP in membership fees. :)

2. Guidelines:  

* Provide guidelines in heretofore ambiguous areas
* Come up with frequent and simple patient/ office-based
guidelines
* Continued CME as above; endorsement/summarizing of
clinical practice guidelines
* Regular updates on recommendations/guidelines. Not
being in an academic environment can be challenging
to get the most up to date information and journals are
not very focused on guidelines issues.

3. Improved quality measures:  

* Please lobby for more scientifically developed
standards of quality assessment. Targets not set in
strong scientific foundations hurt doctors and patients
alike. Quality measures which have known interventions
should be selected, otherwise there is a danger of
forcing providers to cherry pick their patients.
* Lobbying to include patient-centered measures in
metrics that determine reimbursement, as a perfect
phosphorus or putting in an AVF is not the right metric
of the quality of my care in a physically declining 80
year old patient who still wants to do dialysis.
* Use ASN leadership to use their legislative and lobbying
efforts to better assess outcomes and reward quality of
care than to just correct numbers!

4. Professional empowerment:  

* Increase physician oversight in the for profit dialysis
unit. Specifically, physician who do not have a stake in
the profits.
* Fighting to get rid of the many nonsensical CMS
regulations that make it much harder for me to provide
the right care to the right patient.
* ASN should adopt a statement on work life balance
and workaholism. This is our achilles heel and I worry it
impacts recruiting.

5. Patient information and education:  

* Provide ‘information for patients’ portals or handouts.
Might help keep our patients informed and save time for
providers.
* Work directly with patients to help them understand
importance of adherence with therapy. Advocacy
to government regarding issues with non-adherent
patients and the fact we are obligated to take care of
them when they don’t do their part and yet it affects our
reimbursement
* Create standardized handouts for nephrology handouts
that are free to physicians and can be given to patients.
Advocate for increased payments for Medicare patients.
* More patient educational material to understand CKD
and final stages in understanding different modalities
