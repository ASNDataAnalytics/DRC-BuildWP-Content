The NHANES program began in the early 1960s and has been conducted as a series 
of surveys focusing on different population groups or health topics. In 1999, 
the survey became a continuous program that has a changing focus on a variety of 
health and nutrition measurements to meet emerging needs. The survey examines a 
nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons 
are located in counties across the country, 15 of which are visited each year.

The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and 
health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, 
and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by 
highly trained medical personnel.
