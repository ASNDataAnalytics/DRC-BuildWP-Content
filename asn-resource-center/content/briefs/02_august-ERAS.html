<h3>AY 2019 Nephrology Match Update: August/September ERAS Applications</h3>
<p>August and September <a href="https://www.aamc.org/data/facts/eras/">ERAS</a> application
data for the appointment year (AY) 2019 nephrology Match exhibited diverging
trends. While applications declined in August, year-over-year totals are trending
above the past 3 Match cycles.</p>
<div id="fall-rebound-in-candidates-and-applications" class="section level4">
<h4>Fall Rebound in Candidates and Applications</h4>
<p>New nephrology candidates applying in August continued their recent decline,
but September saw a bump in new candidates (40), an 11% increase over AY 2018.
The uptick is expected and likely an artifact of residents changing career plans
mid–application cycle. Nephrology candidates have recently had the highest
proportion of ERAS cross-specialty registrations (excepting allied
subspecialties such as Pulm–CCM) and new data from the <em>Report
on the 2018 Nephrology Fellow Survey</em>—being released October 15, 2018—found
only 35.4% of respondents had considered nephrology as their only career option.</p>

<p>New application numbers mirror those for candidates, but September totals increased<br />
40% over last application cycle, with each applicant submitting to an average of 12
programs.</p>

<h5>Educational Status</h5>
<p>Broken down by educational status, US international medical graduates (US IMGs)
have offset declines among both USMGs and IMGs over the past 2 months.</p>

<div id="year-over-yearcandidates-and-applications" class="section level4">
<h4>Year over Year—Candidates and Applications</h4>
<p>Total candidates and applications continue to trend higher over AY 2018 application
cycle (7.8% and 8.7%, respectively). As of September, candidate totals are
trending higher than the past 3 application cycles (AY 2016–AY 2018).</p>

<div id="educational-status-1" class="section level5">
<h5>Educational Status</h5>
<p>To date, IMGs have rebounded over last year by 12% and US IMGs are up 28%.
Yet, the number of US MDs dropped 13% over September of last year (when 91 US MDs
matched in nephrology), pointing to a lower total for AY 2019 (Figure 9).</p>
