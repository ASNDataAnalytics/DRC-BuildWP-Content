#### What is the ASN Data Analytics Program?    

The ASN Data Analytics Program supports informed, strategic decision-making and implementation of ASN initiatives and programs by collecting, managing, analyzing and synthesizing data relevant to nephrology and nephrology professionals.

The Data Analytics Program was created in April 2016 to advance ASNâ€™s mission
and strategic goals. The Program will continue to assess and enumerate knowledge and data resource gaps, as well as potential approaches to address these.

Among the core questions are:

* How is the nephrology workforce changing?
* How can the specialty become more representative of the US and patient population?
* How is nephrology practice evolving, both in private and academic settings?
* How many nephrologists will the US need to produce over the next 5, 10, and 20 years?
* How can we analyze the contributions of, career paths for, and employment obstacles faced by IMG nephrologists?
* What are the factors influencing career paths/specialty choice among students and residents?
* What approaches can help alleviate geographic maldistribution of kidney health professionals?

#### How can I survey ASN members? 

Please refer to the [ASN Research Survey Policy](/files/2018-02-21_ASN-Research-Survey-Policy_REV.pdf). ASN 
offers two outlets for extramural researchers to access nephrology fellows.   

#### What is the ASN Nephrology Fellow Survey?

Conducted in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine 
under Principal Investigator Stephen M. Sozio, MD, MHS, MEHP, FASN, the ASN 
Nephrology Fellow Survey provides leading indicators on the job market, practice 
patterns, and nephrologist demand. The study has been reviewed by the Johns 
Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Research Board (Study # 00205206).

#### What is the ASN Nephrology GME Census? 

As sponsor of the nephrology Match, ASN conducts an annual census of fellows in training. Excepting the number of 1st-year fellows reporting for training (required by
the [National Resident Matching Program](http://www.nrmp.org/)) all data
are used for research purposes only. 

#### What is the ASN Data Subcommittee?

The ASN Data Subcommittee is part of the ASN Workforce and Training Committee, currently chaired by Stephen M. Sozio, MD, MHS, MEHP, FASN. The Subcommittee comprises 
multiple stakeholders---including Training Program Directors and Nephrology Fellows---
who provide recommendations for approaches to identify and address data and knowledge
gaps.
